In line with MOE’s Specific Aims of EL Syllabus 2020, Pei Tong Primary School desires every Pei Tong student to use English with impact, effect and affect.  In order to enable them to do so, our English department implements structured programmes to hone our students’ English Language skills under the four broad areas of **Writing, Reading, Listening and Speaking**.  

  

We hope that our programmes would nurture them to read and listen critically with an understanding of various text forms while writing and speaking the language with grammar and vocabulary applied accurately and appropriately.  Last but not least, our department also encourages our students to let their creative juices flow and come up with content that is original and interesting. 

## 21st Century Competencies

We are also constantly and consciously nurturing our students to achieve the 21st Century Competencies which include the following:  

*   **core values with character as the foundation of learning and behaviour**
*   **social and emotional competencies**
*   **global awareness and cross-cultural skills**
