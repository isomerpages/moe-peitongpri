# I Write with An Intent

## Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)


For the lower primary, writing lessons are carried out in the form of the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA). In this approach, students learn to write not in isolation but together as a class as well as part of a group.

  

The first stage of MLEA includes a hands-on activity in which our students would have to describe or narrate in writing.  At the end of the primary experience, the teacher carries out class writing with the class by eliciting ideas from our students and penning down their thoughts.  At the end of the class writing, the teacher would model how editing is carried out in order to ensure grammatical accuracy and the appropriate use of vocabulary.

  

Our students would now have a clear idea of what to write and begin their group writings which enable group members to share ideas, help one another and apply useful pointers and phrases from the teacher. The resulting narrative is a group effort that gives our students the skills and confidence to write their own individual compositions.

## Upper Primary Creative Writing


Our English Department trains our mid and upper primary students in creative writing with the use of the Story Mountain strategy.  It is a systematic way to help our students visually plan the plot in distinctive stages or sections. As the name suggests, the plot builds to a climax or a problem (C3.1) that needs to be overcome.  The story begins with a setting (C1), followed by the causes of the problem with we term Rising Action 1 and Rising Action 2 (C2).  After the climax at the peak of the mountain, what follows on the other side of the mountain is the problem being overcome and resolved.  We term the resolutions Falling Action 1 and Falling Action 2 (C3.2).  The story ends with a closure or a conclusion (C4) to the story.

  

We also introduce ideas for the climax by teaching our students about various kinds of conflicts in order to dramatise the content.  These conflicts include conflicts with the antagonist, conflicts within the self (dilemmas) or conflicts with society or establishments (law-breaking, radicalism). Last but not least, we instil critical thinking in our students by discussing the meanings and implications of various themes and how to render the content relevant to each specific theme.

  

The next stage of composition writing deals with English language proficiency.  Class editing or peer editing of a composition sample is carried out as class activities so as to reinforce grammatical accuracy and the appropriate use of vocabulary.

## Authentic writing activities


The department arranges activities for our students of all levels to integrate authentic writing activities with the school’s Value-in-Action (VIA) Programmes/ Social Studies (SS) Curriculum from P1 to P6:

*   P1 –  A Thank You Note to Parents (PAL ART Lesson 6)
