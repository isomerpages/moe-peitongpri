# Read @ PT

Reading helps a person to learn and grow. As a famous poet Margaret Atwood puts it succinctly, “I read for pleasure and that is the moment I learn the most.”  

  

At Pei Tong, we strongly believe that when our students develop a love and competency in reading, independent learning will take place. Putting our belief into practice, our school’s reading program seeks to nurture their love for reading through the use of various reading platforms that are tailored to build their reading interest and capacity.

  

Our reading program is guided by the principles that are Literature-rich, Interesting, Fun, and Engaging (LIFE)  for the students.

## Go Read A Book (GRAB)

“Go, Read A Book” (GRAB) comprises 4 different level reader books, ranging from emergent readers to intermediate readers that are placed in the class library. These books are carefully curated to suit the reading needs of our students.

Every month, the students will write book reviews based on the story plot, and characters that they have read from the class library and recommend the books they have read to their peers verbally.  The books are rotated among the classes on a termly basis to ensure that each student would be given the opportunity to read 120 books in a year.

  

## Uninterrupted Silent and Sustained Reading


Uninterrupted Silent & Sustained Reading (USSR) is conducted during alternate library periods where our students will read books and engage in fun literary activities to earn star reader collar badges upon task completion.

These tasks aim to arouse students’ interest in reading as well as to encourage literature appreciation. Some of these interesting tasks include reading to an audience, bookmark-making, writing a letter to the character from a book, writing an alternative ending to the story, and many more.

## Our Time To E-Read


“Our Time To E-Read” (OTTER) allows our students to read e-books or audiobooks during alternate library periods. Through our school’s subscription to Keylinks Digital Reader online app, it is made accessible to all our students to read during the library periods in class.

  

The app offers 6 levels of differentiation according to word count and vocabulary. After reading, the students are given an opportunity to share their after-thoughts about the characters in the story with the class fortnightly. The interactivity and animations enhance the reading experience of our students.

## Little Red Dot and PT Lines


Little Red Dot (LRD) is the ‘The Straits Times’ educational supplement that focuses on news articles and current events intertwined with elements of social-emotional learning, as well as Values Education and National Education.

In addition, Pei Tong Lessons in the News and Stories (PTLines) is conducted every Tuesday after pledge-taking in class. It gives all our students exposure to interesting newspaper articles, keeping them abreast of current affairs in Singapore as well as the world.

Moreover, students are able to listen to professional storytellers online during alternate sessions. The online storytelling sessions are differentiated according to lower (P1-P3) and upper (P4-P6) blocks to allow greater literature appreciation by engaging students in discussions on broader themes in the story.

## School e-Repository Resource


School e-Repository Resource (SERR) gives our students a wide selection of online resources to choose from. These include students’ TED talks, NLB online ebook loans, read-along ebooks, and virtual tours.

Leveraging SERR as one of our e-reading platforms during library periods, SERR is also made accessible to our students and parents via our school website to cultivate independent and extensive reading after school hours.

## Storytelling and Engaging Activities at the School Library


The school library offers a range of interesting programmes to pique students’ interest in reading and encourage them to explore reading books from a variety of genres. These include:

*   Fortnightly storytelling sessions for P1 to P4 are conducted during recess on Wednesdays by our teachers
*   Monthly thematic book displays, book recommendations, and contests
*   Hot-seating of prominent book characters and blackout poem writing during recess for P5 and P6 students

## Partnership


As our school places heavy emphasis on reading, we have also partnered with the National Library Board (NLB) to promote reading to our students through mass book loans and book talks every term.
