Our Pei Tong Parent Support Group (PSG) consists of parents with varied interests and talents and has served as a vital partner to the school over the years.

Other than providing feedback, our PSG has helped to support the school in programmes, such as learning journeys and recess activities. Over the years, our PSG has also helped to organise the school’s talent show competition to highlight the wonderful abilities of our students.  

  

We welcome all parents to join our PSG or to serve as Parent Volunteers on an ad-hoc basis!
