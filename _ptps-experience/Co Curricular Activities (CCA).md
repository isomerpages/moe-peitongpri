<h2>CCA @ Pei Tong</h2>
<p>At Pei Tong Primary School, we believe in providing a holistic experience
for every child. CCAs allow our students to discover their interests and
talents outside the classroom and promote interactions and friendships
among students from diverse backgrounds. Through CCAs, students discover
more about themselvesâ€”their strengths, values, ability to rise to challenges,
and capacity to stretch beyond their limits.</p>
