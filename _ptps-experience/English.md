<h2>Desired Outcomes</h2>
<p>The English Language Department aims to empower students to engage thoughtfully,
express themselves clearly, approach the world with curiosity and compassion,
and use the English language effectively and impactfully.</p>
<p>At Pei Tong Primary School, students experience structured programmes
and authentic learning activities designed to hone their English language
skills in four key areas: Writing, Reading, Listening, and Speaking. They
develop the ability to read and listen critically, with an understanding
of various text forms, while learning to write and speak with accurate
and appropriate grammar and vocabulary. Students are also encouraged to
create original and engaging content and to apply their skills both within
and beyond the classroom.</p>
<h2>21st Century Competencies</h2>
<p>We nurture students to achieve the 21st Century Competencies which include
the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>social and emotional competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>global awareness and cross-cultural skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>core values with character as the foundation of learning and behaviour</p>
</li>
</ul>
