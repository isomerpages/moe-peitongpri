<h2>Citizenship Dispositions</h2>
<p>In Pei Tong, we hope to develop an understanding and appreciation of Singapore
and citizenship in this world of complexity, in our students. National
Education (NE) will be anchored on the following citizenship dispositions,
which will enable our students to realise their part in the flourishing
of their community and nation:</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>
<br>To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding
of the values that are important to us as a nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>
<br>To be aware of contemporary realities including Singapore’s constraints
and vulnerabilities which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of
a less predictable world.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>
<br>Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience
to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Will to Act</strong>
<br>Ultimately, these citizenship dispositions cultivate the will to act:
To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared
mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
<h2>NE Commemorative Events</h2>
<p>Beyond formal Character and Citizenship Education lessons and the celebration
of festive events of the various races in Singapore, the four NE Commemorative
Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day,
and National Day) are integral to students’ learning experiences in school.</p>
<p>Through these commemorative days, students learn valuable lessons from
significant moments in Singapore’s history and reflect on how to apply
their learning to contribute as active citizens.</p>

<h2>P5 National Education Show</h2>
<p>All Primary 5 students will have the opportunity to attend the P5 National
Education Show (National Day Parade Preview). This experience enables them
to witness the spirit of national pride and learn about Singapore’s history
and culture, fostering a deeper sense of belonging and identity within
the community.</p>

<h2>Social Studies Learning Journeys</h2>
<p>Authentic learning experiences are an integral part of teaching and learning
Social Studies at Pei Tong. Each year, students participate in field-based
learning through excursions to museums and heritage trails.</p>
<p>These experiences enhance students’ understanding and appreciation of
Singapore, allowing them to connect the knowledge they've gained with real-world
experiences.</p>
