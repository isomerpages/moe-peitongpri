<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>Every child an <strong>e</strong>xemplary role model who is <strong>e</strong>nthusiastic
and passionate, strives for <strong>e</strong>xcellence, <strong>e</strong>mpowers
and enables the team, and <strong>e</strong>ncourages peers to be good and
do good.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Student Leadership Framework</h2>
<p>Adapting from Kouzes and Posner’s Leadership Challenge of “The 5 practices
and 10 commitments of Exemplary Leadership” Model, the 5 ‘E’s behavioural
traits of a Pei Tong student form the foundational dispositions that we
envision our students to emulate as leaders.</p>

<p>Here in Pei Tong, we develop students in dimensions of Self Leadership,
Team Leadership and Thought Leadership. Students are provided developmental
opportunities through trainings as well as with platforms for service whether
as Tier 1, 2, or 3 leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Tier 1: Class-based Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> aims to promote leadership for all as Class-based
Leaders through taking up class-based roles where students have<strong> </strong>opportunities
to foundationally lead self and peers, within the class or within their
respective levels. Every student is given this opportunity to be a leader.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Tier 2: Specialist Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> offers students opportunities for leadership development
as Specialist Leaders in one of the 5 leadership groups (Prefects, CCA
Leaders, AR Reps, CCE Ambassadors and Upstanders). These are targeted,
positional leadership roles each with a specific area of focus/advocacy.&nbsp;
P4 – P6 students who display the potential and capacity to serve beyond
class-based responsibilities are identified, nominated and appointed.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Tier 3: EXCO</h3>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> is the highest level of leadership where elected
P5 Tier 2 Student Leaders form the Student Leadership EXCO<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Executive
Committee). The Student Leadership EXCO heads their respective leadership
groups, and they are provided opportunities to lead other Student Leaders
and the school by working alongside each other and teachers to organise
school events, lead school initiatives, promote causes, and contribute
to the community/society. There is a vigorous election process to appoint
the most suitable student leaders for the EXCO team.</p>
