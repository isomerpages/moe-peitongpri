## Citizenship Dispositions


In Pei Tong, we hope to develop an understanding and appreciation of Singapore and citizenship in this world of complexity, in our students. National Education (NE) will be anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our students to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation:

  

**A Sense of Belonging**<br>
To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation. 

  

**A Sense of Reality**<br>
To be aware of contemporary realities including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.

  

**A Sense of Hope**<br>
Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.  

  

**A Will to Act**<br>
Ultimately, these citizenship dispositions cultivate the will to act: To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.  

## NE Commemorative Events
Beyond the formal Character and Citizenship Education lessons, the four NE Commemorative Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day) are an important part of students’ learning experiences in school. 

Through these NE commemorative days, students learn important lessons from significant moments in Singapore’s history, and reflect on how they can apply their learning to contribute as active citizens.
  

## P5 National Education Show
All P5 students will have the opportunity to attend the P5 National Education Show (National Day Parade Preview).

## Social Studies Learning Journeys
Authentic learning experience forms part of the teaching and learning of Social Studies. In Pei Tong, each year, students participate in field-based learning through learning journeys that take them to places like the museums and heritage trails. 

These experiences strengthen students’ understanding and appreciation of Singapore and enable them to make connections between knowledge learnt with real, authentic experiences.
