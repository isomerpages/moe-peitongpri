<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>One key platform that drives the desired CCE outcomes is our Values-In-Action
(VIA) programme - ‘iCare’. It adopts the ‘3A’ approach of creating ‘<strong>Awareness</strong>’,
providing platforms for students to put into ‘<strong>Action</strong>’
to serve, with the intent to develop in them the ‘<strong>Attitude</strong>’
of desiring to give back to the community and serve.</p>

care and make a difference in the community.</p>
