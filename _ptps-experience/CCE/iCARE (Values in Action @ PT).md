# iCARE (Values in Action @ PT)

One key platform that drives the desired CCE outcomes is our Values-In-Action (VIA) programme - ‘iCare’. It adopts the ‘3A’ approach of creating ‘**Awareness**’, providing platforms for students to put into ‘**Action**’ to serve, with the intent to develop in them the ‘**Attitude**’ of desiring to give back to the community and serve.

## Approach and Goals

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
		<td><b>Awareness</b></td>
    <td>To help students see the relationship between the community and themselves</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
		<td><b>Action</b></td>
    <td>To provide students with avenues to express their care to the community</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Attitude</b></td>
    <td>To influence students to make the choice to care for the community</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*   **C**onversation: Teacher-led discussion on the iCare experience
*   **A**ction: Different ways that students can take action
*   **RE**flection: Reflect through what has been done and what students can continue to do

Through our iCare programme, we hope that our students will become more aware of the needs in the community and explore ways that they can show care and make a difference in the community.
