# 'I Influence' (Student Leadership @ PT)


Here in Pei Tong, we believe that every student can be a leader. To become effective leaders, students must learn to lead themselves and work well with others.  

  

Our school provides leadership training for student leaders so that they can grow in confidence, collaborate creatively to solve problems and be more socially responsible, With these skills, they can make a difference in their class, school and the community.
