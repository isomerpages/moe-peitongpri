# Goal

We aim to introduce students to a wide array of occupations, including new jobs created in the ever-changing world of work.

Through such exposure, students will become more aware of their interests, abilities and career aspirations in relation to self and to others. Through play, they will also learn to incorporate their initial preferences into occupational roles.

Students can discover more about themselves through games and tools, explore the Singapore Education Landscape and learn more about the World of Work through videos and over 1000 job role information.&nbsp;
