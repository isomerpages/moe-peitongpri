<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Through Pei Tong's Education and Career Guidance programme, we aim to
introduce students to a wide array of occupations, including new jobs created
in the ever-changing world of work.</p>
<p>Through such exposure, students will become more aware of their interests,
abilities and career aspirations in relation to self and to others. Through
play, they will also learn to incorporate their initial preferences into
occupational roles.</p>

videos and over 1000 job role information.</p>
