<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To achieve our desired CCE outcomes, we engage students in our Values-In-Action
(VIA) programme, '<strong>iCare</strong>.' This programme adopts the ‘3A’
approach: creating ‘<strong>Awareness</strong>,’ providing opportunities
for students to take ‘<strong>Action</strong>’ in service, and fostering
an ‘<strong>Attitude</strong>’ of giving back to the community.</p>
