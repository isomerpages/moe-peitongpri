The P2 students participated in an MT fortnight activity - Clay Making. Students learnt about the brief history of this popular folk art. They get to create various shapes from clay and sculpt their masterpieces into an animal. Students were engaged and had a fun time making their animal keychains.

To stimulate and encourage students’ interest and joy in reading, the Chinese department organised a Chinese Writers’ Talk and Sharing session for all P3 and P4 students. On this day, all P3 and P4 students attended an interactive Chinese storytelling session during their Chinese Lessons. Students were given the opportunity to interact with the instructor, and some were also selected to take part in a role-playing activity. Through this storytelling session, students were exposed to an enriching and positive reading experience.

  

In addition to the Chinese Writers’ Talk and Sharing session, the Chinese department also came up with a Reading Booklet for all P3 and P4 students. The Reading Booklet comprises different reading activities, and students are highly encouraged to complete the activities.

This year, the Primary 5 students participated in different activities to learn the Chinese Language in a fun and engaging way. These activities are mainly extension tasks aiming to create meaningful and authentic learning experiences for the students.

  

For example, one of the Primary 5 classes was given the challenge to write their own recipe and create their own meal. They were assessed based on their recipe, plating and teamwork.  The students got their creative juices flowing and came up with many interesting recipes!

In line with textbook content, another Primary 5 class was also tasked to write online lost and found notices for actual items that were found in the lost and found corner in school. Students connect what they have learnt in class to real-life situations, making their learning process more meaningful and engaging

Through the lessons, students learn about various jobs and occupations. Teachers provide learning packages for students to understand the description and demands of the various jobs and occupations. Students will learn what doctors, nurses, gardeners, policemen and more, do daily. At the end of the lessons, students have a chance to role-play the occupations that they are interested in.  The lessons provide real-life experiences for students to practice and apply the language skills or knowledge they learned.
