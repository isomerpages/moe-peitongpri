# Malay Department

Students learn Malay in authentic learning experiences where lessons have different themes or scenarios to provide real life experiences for students to apply the language skills or knowledge they have learnt.

## Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight 

The MTL Fortnight activities serve to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. In 2022, students learnt about Malay folklore.

Through the humorous stories of larger-than-life characters like Pak Pandir, Si Luncai, Pak Kaduk dan mak Andeh, students learnt that laziness and naivety would get one into trouble. They learnt about the misadventures of these characters through group work facilitated by ICT tools.
