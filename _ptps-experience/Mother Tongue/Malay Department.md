<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Malay Department’s activities offer students opportunities to actively
use and explore the Malay language, fostering language proficiency and
cultural understanding through hands-on learning and engaging experiences.</p>
<h3>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight</h3>
<p>The Malay Department’s annual Mother Tongue Fortnight immerses students
in Malay culture, enhancing their appreciation of traditional art forms
through hands-on experiences. Lower primary students explore tarian (dance),
middle primary learn about wayang kulit (puppetry), and upper primary experience
dikir barat (musical performance). Each level participates in presentations
to understand the cultural significance before trying them firsthand, fostering
a deeper connection with Malay heritage.</p>

<h3>Conversational Chinese Malay Programme</h3>
<p>The Conversational Chinese Malay programme offers students opportunities
to learn and practise real-life communication in both languages through
engaging scenarios. The programme wraps up with a lively, hands-on activity
where students practise conversations in a supermarket setting. Taking
on different roles, they use the language they have learnt to navigate
everyday situations like shopping and asking for prices.</p>

Lensa Si Cilik, and Cepat Tepat, showcasing their skills in language, critical
thinking, and teamwork. These competitions offer valuable opportunities
