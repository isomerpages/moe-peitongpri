<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Malay Department’s activities offer students opportunities to actively
use and explore the Malay language, fostering language proficiency and
cultural understanding through hands-on learning and engaging experiences.</p>
<h2>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight</h2>
<p>The Malay Department’s annual Mother Tongue Fortnight focuses on immersing
students in Malay culture, providing them with a deeper appreciation of
traditional art forms through hands-on experiences. Lower primary students
explore tarian (traditional dance), middle primary students learn about
wayang kulit (shadow puppetry), and upper primary students experience dikir
barat (a traditional Malay musical performance). Each level participates
in presentations to understand the cultural significance of these art forms
before trying them out firsthand. This hands-on approach helps students
connect with and appreciate the rich heritage of Malay cultural performances.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Conversational Chinese Malay Programme</h2>
<p>The Conversational Chinese Malay programme offers students opportunities
to learn and practise real-life communication in both languages through
engaging scenarios. The programme wraps up with a lively, hands-on activity
where students practise conversations in a supermarket setting. Taking
on different roles, they use the language they’ve learnt to navigate everyday
situations like shopping and asking for prices.</p>
<p>This interactive activity reinforces their skills and celebrates their
progress in the programme, giving students a memorable and practical experience
to apply their language learning.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Theatre-In-Education</h2>
<p>The Theatre-In-Education programme aims to provide students with an immersive
learning experience, where they engage with the arts to enhance their understanding
of cultural, social, and linguistic concepts.</p>
<p>This unique and enriching experience uses drama, activities, and games
to actively engage students. Each performance explores important themes
such as communication, cooperation, empathy, and embracing diversity, all
of which are crucial to students’ holistic development.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Our students actively participate in external competitions such as Sahibba,
Lensa Si Cilik, and Cepat Tepat, showcasing their skills in language, critical
thinking, and teamwork. These competitions offer valuable opportunities
for students to apply their learning in real-world contexts, build confidence,
and develop important life skills such as problem-solving, communication,
and resilience.</p>
