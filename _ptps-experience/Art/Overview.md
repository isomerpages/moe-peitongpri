<h2>Core Learning Experiences</h2>
<p>The core learning experiences in our Art curriculum are thoughtfully designed
to provide an inclusive and authentic art education for all students, fostering
shared memories of their artistic journey. Our programmes emphasise three
key components:</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Drawing</h3>
<p>As the cornerstone of our Art curriculum across all six primary levels,
drawing serves as a powerful tool for self-expression and imagination.
This foundational experience nurtures language, cognitive, and executive
functions through the use of diverse materials and processes. It prioritises
fostering self-confidence and joy in artistic expression over technical
perfection, encouraging students to explore their creativity freely.</p>

<h3>Museum-based Learning</h3>
<p>This programme immerses Primary 4 students in Singapore's rich cultural
heritage through guided visits to local art museums. By engaging as both
artists and audience, students cultivate an appreciation for art while
contributing to a shared artistic experience through their own creative
expressions.</p>

<h3>Exhibition in Curriculum</h3>
<p>This programme integrates artwork display and curation into the learning
process across all levels, evolving from classroom presentations to school-wide
and community showcases. Students gain a deeper understanding of aesthetics
and communication through art presentation while fostering a sense of pride
and ownership in their artistic journey.</p>
