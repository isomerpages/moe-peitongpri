<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every student, an engaged Mathematics learner.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students master mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based
lessons using Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. They also learn
to reason and communicate mathematical ideas during group activities. These
approaches help build numeracy skills, foster greater interest in the subject,
and develop better problem-solvers to function effectively in everyday
life.</p>
<h2>Mathematics Made Meaningful (M³)</h2>
<p>A child learns best through ‘play’. Students experience authentic learning
experiences to make learning of mathematical concepts more joyful. Their
conceptual understanding is enhanced through manipulatives and/ or technology.
During group work, teachers use Talk Moves to encourage and guide students
to reason and communicate their thinking, so that they become confident
problem-solvers.</p>

<h2>Mastery in Mathematics (M²)</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PTPS%20Experience/math.png">
</div>
<p>All children learn differently and can strive to be at their best at various
stages of learning. Resources are created to cater to the diverse learning
needs of the students.</p>
<p>Mastery worksheets focus on a broad content strand on Numbers to form
the fundamentals of numeracy skills. Problem-solving-skills packages, designed
with Polya’s 4-step Problem-Solving Techniques in mind, are also introduced
progressively at each level to help students develop competency in thinking
skills.</p>
<p>Selected high ability upper primary students attend E2K Mathematics Programme,
an MOE designed enrichment programme. It aims to develop their mathematical
reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry
approach.</p>

<h2>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PTPS%20Experience/LSM.jpg">
</div>
<p>LSM is a specialised early intervention programme that provides additional
support for the development of numeracy skills. Primary 1 students are
screened and selected for the programme.</p>
<p>Students in the LSM programme are fully supported by LSM-trained teachers
during curriculum. They attend small group lessons for more specialised
attention. Learning support may continue in Primary 3 if they need more
support beyond lower primary. d be given to meet the learning needs of
these students.</p>
<h2>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PTPS%20Experience/ican.jpg">
</div>
<p>All children can learn. ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools
and MOE to support and raise the confidence and achievement level of low
progress learners beyond Primary 2.</p>
<h3>Features of ICAN</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Supported by ICAN-trained teachers, who use intervention strategies to
help students strengthen their conceptual understanding and procedural
fluency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller class size for more specialised attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factual fluency and interleaved distributed practice to help students
recall and revise basis facts regularly</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Selected upper primary students can apply their higher-order thinking
skills and gain exposure in external competitions, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (SMOPS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS High School National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
