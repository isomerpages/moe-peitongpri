<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every student, an engaged Mathematics learner.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Pei Tong, we are committed to fostering a deep and enduring love for
Mathematics in every student. We believe in creating a solid foundation
of mathematical understanding through innovative and engaging teaching
methods. In line with joyful learning, the mastery of mathematical concepts
and skills is achieved through activity-based lessons using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
(CPA) approach. Emphasis is also placed on developing in students, the
ability to reason and communicate ideas in Mathematics during group activities.
These approaches help build numeracy skills, foster greater interest in
the subject, as well as develop better problem-solvers to function effectively
in everyday life.</p>

<h2>Mathematics Made Meaningful (M³)</h2>
<p>A child learns best through ‘play’, which is why we aim to make learning
both enjoyable and meaningful.</p>

<p>Manipulatives and/ or technology are used to enhance the understanding
of concepts. During collaborative learning, teachers use Talk Moves to
encourage and guide students to reason and communicate their mathematical
thinking, so that they become confident problem-solvers.</p>

<h2>Mastery in Mathematics (M²)</h2>
<p>We believe that students learn differently and can strive to be at their
best at various stages of learning. Our resources are created to cater
to the diverse learning needs of the students. Our Mastery worksheets focus
concepts that form the fundamentals of numeracy skills. Problem-Solving-Skills
package, which are designed with Polya’s 4-step Problem-Solving approach
in mind, are also introduced progressively at each level to help students
develop competency in thinking skills.</p>

<p>To further stretch the potential of students with high ability in Mathematics,
some students in Primary 4 &amp; 5 will be selected for E2K Mathematics
Programme, an enrichment programme designed by MOE. It aims to enhance
students' mathematical reasoning skills and conceptual understanding through
an inquiry-based approach.</p>

<h2>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</h2>
<p>The Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme is a specialised
early intervention initiative that provides additional support to develop
numeracy skills. A screening process is carried out at the beginning of
Primary 1 to identify the students for intervention.</p>
<p>Students in the LSM programme receive dedicated support from LSM-trained
teachers during lessons, with small group sessions for more focused attention.
If needed, learning support may continue in Primary 3 and further meet
the learning needs of these students.</p>

<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Selected upper primary students will be invited to apply their higher-order
thinking skills and participate in external competitions, such as:</p>
<p>• Raffles Mathematical Olympiad (RMO)</p>
<p>• Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (APMOPS)</p>
<p>• NUS High School National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOΣ)</p>
