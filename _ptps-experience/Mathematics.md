# Overview

**Our Vision**<br>
_Every student, an engaged Mathematics learner._

Students master mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. They also learn to reason and communicate mathematical ideas during group activities. These approaches help build numeracy skills, foster greater interest in the subject, and develop better problem-solvers to function effectively in everyday life. 

## Mathematics Made Meaningful (M³)



A child learns best through ‘play’. Students experience authentic learning experiences to make learning of  mathematical concepts more joyful. Their conceptual understanding is enhanced through manipulatives and/ or technology. During group work, teachers use Talk Moves to encourage and guide students to reason and communicate their thinking, so that they become confident problem-solvers.

## Mastery in Mathematics (M²)

All children learn differently and can strive to be at their best at various stages of learning. Resources are created to cater to the diverse learning needs of the students.

Mastery worksheets focus on a broad content strand on Numbers to form the fundamentals of numeracy skills. Problem-solving-skills packages, designed with Polya’s 4-step Problem-Solving Techniques in mind, are also introduced progressively at each level to help students develop competency in thinking skills.

Selected high ability upper primary students attend E2K Mathematics Programme, an MOE designed enrichment programme. It aims to develop their mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

## Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

LSM is a specialised early intervention programme that provides additional support for the development of numeracy skills. Primary 1 students are screened and selected for the programme. 

Students in the LSM programme are fully supported by LSM-trained teachers during curriculum. They attend small group lessons for more specialised attention. Learning support may continue in Primary 3 if they need more support beyond lower primary.
d be given to meet the learning needs of these students.

## Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)

All children can learn. ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support and raise the confidence and achievement level of low progress learners beyond Primary 2. 

### Features of ICAN
* Supported by ICAN-trained teachers, who use intervention strategies to help students strengthen their conceptual understanding and procedural fluency
* Smaller class size for more specialised attention
* Factual fluency and interleaved distributed practice to help students recall and revise basis facts regularly

## Competitions

Selected upper primary students can apply their higher-order thinking skills and gain exposure in external competitions, such as:

* Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (SMOPS)
* NUS High School National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)
