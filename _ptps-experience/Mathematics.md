# Mathematics

**Our Vision**

_Every student, an engaged Mathematics learner._

Students master mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. They also learn to reason and communicate mathematical ideas during group activities. These approaches help build numeracy skills, foster greater interest in the subject, and develop better problem-solvers to function effectively in everyday life. 

## Mathematics Made Meaningful (M3)

A child learns best through ‘play’. Students experience authentic learning experiences to make learning of  mathematical concepts more joyful. Their conceptual understanding is enhanced through manipulatives and/ or technology. During group work, teachers use Talk Moves to encourage and guide students to reason and communicate their thinking, so that they become confident problem-solvers.

## Mastery in Mathematics (M2)

We believe that students learn differently and can strive to be at their best at various stages of learning. Our resources are created to cater to the diverse learning needs of the students. Our Mastery worksheets focus on a broad content strand on Numbers, as it includes various sub-topics which form the fundamentals of numeracy skills. Problem-Solving-Skills booklets, which are designed with Polya’s 4-step Problem-Solving Techniques in mind, are also introduced progressively at each level to help students develop competency in thinking skills.  

  

To further stretch the potential of students with high ability in Mathematics, some students in Primary 6 will be selected for E2K Mathematics Programme, which is an enrichment programme designed by MOE. It aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

## Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

LSM is an early intervention programme (Primary 1 and 2) aimed at providing additional learning support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. A screening process is carried out at the beginning of Primary 1 to identify the students for intervention. 

  

In our school, students who are identified for the LSM programme will be fully supported by our LSM teachers. Lessons are conducted in small groups so that greater attention could be given to meet the learning needs of these students.

## Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)

As we believe that all children can learn, ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support and raise the confidence and achievement level of low progress learners beyond Primary 2. The students identified for ICAN are supported by ICAN-trained teachers, who use intervention strategies to help students strengthen their conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. The class size is smaller so as to give greater attention to the students during curriculum hours. 

  

Factual Fluency (FF) and Interleaved Distributed Practices (IDP) are two of the strategies that are characteristic of ICAN classes. The daily 5-10 minutes of FF and/ or IDP exercise helps students to recall and revise basic facts regularly and in turn, boost their confidence level to enable them to progress in handling more difficult concepts and skills.

## Competitions


In our school, we strive to provide a platform for our upper primary students to stretch their problem-solving skills and gain exposure to external competitions. Selected Primary 5 and/ or 6 students will be invited to participate in the following competitions:

*   Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC)
*   Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary School (SMOPS)
*   NUS High School National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)
