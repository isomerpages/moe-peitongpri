<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every student, an engaged Mathematics learner.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mathematics Department aims to nurture confident and competent problem-solvers
who can apply mathematical concepts and skills effectively in everyday
life.</p>
<p>At Pei Tong Primary School, students engage in activity-based lessons
using the <strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA)</strong> approach. Through
hands-on activities and collaborative group work, they develop logical
reasoning and learn to communicate mathematical ideas clearly.</p>
<p>These methods build numeracy skills, spark a deeper interest in Mathematics,
and empower students to approach challenges with confidence and creativity.</p>

<h2>Mathematics Made Meaningful (M³)</h2>
<p>A child learns best through ‘play’, which is why we aim to make learning
both enjoyable and meaningful.</p>

<p>At Pei Tong Primary School, students participate in hands-on learning
experiences that make mathematical concepts more engaging. Their understanding
is strengthened through the use of manipulatives and technology, which
help bring abstract ideas to life.</p>
<p>In group work, teachers use Talk Moves to encourage students to explain
and reason through their thinking, building their confidence as problem-solvers
and improving their ability to communicate their ideas clearly.</p>

<h2>Mastery in Mathematics (M²)</h2>
<p>Each child learns differently, and we aim to cater to the diverse learning
needs.</p>
<p>Mastery worksheets focus on Numbers to build foundational numeracy skills.
Problem-solving packages, based on Polya’s 4-step Problem-Solving Techniques,
are introduced at each level to strengthen thinking skills.</p>

<p>Selected upper primary students participate in the E2K Mathematics Programme,
an MOE enrichment initiative that enhances mathematical reasoning and conceptual
understanding through inquiry-based learning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</h2>
<p>The Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme is a specialised
early intervention initiative that provides additional support to develop
numeracy skills. Primary 1 students are screened and selected for the programme.</p>
<p>Students in the LSM programme receive dedicated support from LSM-trained
teachers during lessons, with small group sessions for more focused attention.
If needed, learning support may continue in Primary 3 to further meet the
learning needs of these students.</p>

<h2>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</h2>
<p>All children can learn. The ICAN programme is a collaboration between
schools and MOE to support low-progress learners beyond Primary 2, helping
to raise their confidence and achievement levels.</p>
<p><strong>Features of ICAN:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Supported by ICAN-trained teachers, who use targeted intervention strategies
to strengthen students' conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller class sizes for more specialised attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on factual fluency and interleaved distributed practice to help
students regularly recall and revise basic facts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Selected upper primary students have the opportunity to apply their higher-order
thinking skills and participate in external competitions, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS High School National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
