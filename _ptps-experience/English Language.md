# Overview


<img src="/images/PTPS%20Experience/Peitong-StagedShots-100.jpg" style="width:55%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

Our aim is for every student to use English with impact, effect and affect. Students experience structured programmes to hone their English Language skills under the four broad areas of Writing, Reading, Listening and Speaking.  

Students learn to read and listen critically with an understanding of various text forms while writing and speaking the language with accurate and appropriate grammar and vocabulary. They are also encouraged to let their creative juices flow and create original and interesting content.


## 21st Century Competencies

We nurture students to achieve the 21st Century Competencies which include the following:

* social and emotional competencies
* global awareness and cross-cultural skills
* core values with character as the foundation of learning and behaviour
