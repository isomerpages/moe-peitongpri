<h1>Overview&nbsp;</h1>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
</p>
<p><em>To inspire and develop students as innovative inquirers</em>
</p>
<p>Inspire, Inquire and Innovate represents the vision for Science Education
and encapsulates the overall experience of our students in Science education:</p>

<p><strong>Developing Inquiring Learners Through ‘5E’ (DILE) programme</strong> is
a school-wide Science programme that comprises comprehensive thematic teaching
and learning packages for all themes in the Primary 3 to 6 syllabi. Each
package:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>adopts the <strong>‘5E’ (Engage, Explore, Explain, Evaluate and Extend)</strong> approach
as the key pedagogy in the teaching of Science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporates <strong>Assessment for Learning strategies (AfL)</strong> such
as “Concept checkpoint and “Fact or Fiction” to ensure that students have
the necessary understanding before moving on to the next chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes <strong>performance tasks</strong> to provide authentic learning
experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes <strong>activities in the Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong> to
promote self-directed learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes exercises for students to <strong>apply scientific concepts in different contexts</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Science Joy of Learning @ Active Recess (JoL@AR)</h2>
<p>All students have opportunities to interact with live animals to learn
more about their characteristics and life cycles during recess.</p>

<p>JoL@AR Science also engages students to immerse themselves in hands-on
STEM activities. These activities foster their creativity and enhance their
problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2>E2K Science Programme</h2>
<p>Upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science
participate in the E2K science enrichment programme. The aim of E2K is
to develop in them habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess
through scientific investigations involving advanced concepts.</p>

<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Selected upper primary students can apply their higher-order thinking
skills and gain exposure in external competitions, such as:</p>
<p>• Raffles Science Olympiad (RSO)</p>
<p>• Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO)</p>
