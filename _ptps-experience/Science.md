The Pei Tong Science Explorer Programme is designed by our teachers to provide a variety of authentic learning experiences for our P4 students. Through a series of interesting learning activities that involve creative thinking and independent research skills, students can strengthen and deepen their science knowledge. To further enhance our students’ self-directedness, we provide several opportunities for them to take ownership of their own learning.
