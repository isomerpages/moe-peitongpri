# Read @ PT

Read@Pei Tong is an initiative to promote good reading habits among students. Students can enjoy a variety of exciting reading programmes that cater to different reading abilities and interests.

Each student reads at least 120 books in a year through carefully curated GRAB books, which are placed in the class library. These level readers comprise of four different level reader books that cater to both the emergent and intermediate readers. Students will be given the opportunity to share what they have read during GRAB in English lessons through verbal sharing and other activities carried out by the teachers. 

## Uninterrupted Silent and Sustained Reading (USSR)


Students will read books and engage in fun literary activities to earn their very own star reader collar badges during alternate library periods. The badges are awarded to students who have completed tasks like reading to an audience, making of bookmarks, writing a letter to the character in a book, coming up with an alternative ending to the stories and many more.

## School e-Repository Resource
School e-Repository Resource (SERR) gives our students a wide selection of free resources that are made available online. These include students’ TED talks, NLB e-Books loans, read-along e-Books in addition to virtual tours. Leveraging SERR as one of our e-reading platforms helps to cultivate independent readers with extensive reading habits beyond the time spent in school and in the comfort of their own homes.

## OpenLib on Thursdays & Fridays (Storytelling and Engaging Activities at the School Library)
From Term 2 onwards, the school library will offer a range of interesting programmes to pique students’ interest in reading and encourage them to explore books from a wide variety of genres. Students will have the opportunity to visit the library during recesses and immerse themselves in reading activities.
 
Some of these activities include:
* showcase of snippets of books-to-movies titles
* Show and Tell presentations by our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students
* monthly thematic book displays, book recommendations and mini contests
* storytelling sessions conducted by teachers and parent volunteers once every fortnight
