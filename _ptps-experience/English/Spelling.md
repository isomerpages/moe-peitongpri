# Spelling


Learning to spell alone is insufficient. It is about understanding the meanings of the words and using them appropriately in the correct context. In English spelling lessons, our students are required to fill in the blank within a context with the most appropriate word.

For our Primary 1 to Primary 4 students, the spelling lists are made up of words derived from Stellar Readers or vocabulary words and phrases that are useful for essay writing. This would render our spelling programme meaningful as it supports effective writing communication.  

  

For Primary 5 and 6 spelling lessons, our students learn the spelling words in the form of word families which include nouns and their base word from which the nouns are derived.  Instead of memorising unconnected words, these spelling lessons teach students to study patterns of words. 

  

For example, words ending in suffixes like “ –ment”, “-ion”, are likely to be a noun; adding a suffix to a verb (base) is one way of forming a noun. A suffix is a part added to the end of a word and derivational suffixes convey syntactic information regarding grammatical functions. One such example is the transformation from “create” to “creation”. Hence, our upper-primary spelling practices also aim to train students in recognizing the syntactic structure of sentences, which will help them to do well in the Editing, Comprehension Cloze and Sentence Synthesis sections in examinations.

All in all, when our students practise spelling in context, they learn not only using these spelling words but also more about syntactic and semantic identities so that students appreciate their learning experiences. Ultimately, we hope that our students will be able to use standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately and as well as understand how speakers or writers put words together and use language to communicate meaning and achieve impact.
