Students bring the hand puppet to life using their words and actions. Through puppetry, students will learn to read and speak confidently. Students will showcase their language abilities as they present an animated performance in front of their classmates and teachers.

Students use their voices and body movements to act out the characters in the given stories. They also work collaboratively with their peers to put up group performances. Students will become more confident when working with their peers and speaking in front of an audience. 

## P3 - Persuasive Speech 

Students work in groups to put up a one-minute presentation that aims to inform, motivate or convince their audience to believe or to do something. Students will strengthen their critical thinking skills and their social-emotional skills as they work collaboratively.

## Primary 4 -Debate 

Students strengthen their critical thinking skills as they make arguments substantiated with evidence and data. They learn to express themselves coherently and confidently while presenting their arguments in front of an audience. The programme aims to build the oral competencies of students and equip them with the basic vocabulary, terms and structure of a debate.
