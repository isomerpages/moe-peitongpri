# Oral Communication Programme


As part of the English Language Oracy Communications Programme, our Primary 1 to Primary 4 students were introduced to a series of enrichment programmes in Term 3. 

## P1 Puppetry

At Primary 1, our students were introduced to puppetry and each of our young learners was given a hand puppet which they brought to life using their hands and speech during lessons. Through puppetry, our students learned to read and speak confidently. We are proud to see our students put their language skills to practice as they presented an animated performance for their classmates and teachers! 

  

## P2 - Stage Performance

Our Primary 2 students studied Stage Performance. In this programme, students learned to use their voices and body movements to play the characters in the stories. They were also given the opportunity to work collaboratively to put up a performance together. The teachers observed that many students had become more confident in speaking in front of their audience. Some students were also thrilled to have discovered their potential in a stage performance!  

## P3 and P4 - Readers’ Theatre and Persuasive Speech


Our Primary 3 and Primary 4 students were introduced to Readers’ Theatre and Persuasive Speech respectively. At this mid-primary stage, our students were challenged to work in groups independently under the guidance of the trainers and teachers who carried out their roles as facilitators. We were glad to witness that our students exercise critical thinking skills and social skills as they worked collaboratively in putting up a performance or a speech at the end of the enrichment course.
