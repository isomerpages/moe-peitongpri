In this programme, our students familiarise themselves with expository writing in Little Red Dot news articles.  Based on the texts from Little Red Dot, students will carry out the activities instructed in the booklet which we termed Mindful Reader.  This booklet directs students to exercise critical thinking by guiding them to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating information with discernment.<br><br><br><br><br>

Our students are also guided to carry out critical thinking processes which include summary skills, comparing and contrasting situations as well as being instilled with curiosity by questioning techniques.  With these skills, our students will be able to sharpen their comprehension and deepen their understanding of expository texts. The Mindful Reader also contains various types of organisational charts to let students compare and contrast information that they have read.    

  

This booklet would be a useful tool to let our students hone their metacognitive processes as well as nurture our students to be avid readers of current affairs and reports. Exposure to global and national issues will also develop our students to be concerned citizens.  By possessing broad worldviews, we hope that our students will be equipped with the twenty-first-century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills.
