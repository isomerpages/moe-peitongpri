With the help of the Little Red Dot from the Straits Times, students will learn to sharpen their critical thinking as well as comprehension skills and deepen their understanding of the world around them. 

Various types of news articles will be discussed at length to aid students to form deductions based on pieces of evidence from the articles as well their prior knowledge. Opportunities for value inculcation and exploration of character strengths will also be tapped on for deeper discussions. Exposure to contemporary issues in Singapore and around the world will guide our students to be concerned citizens.
