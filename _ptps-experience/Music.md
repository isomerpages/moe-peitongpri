<h2>Music Programmes</h2>
<h4>Primary 1 and 2</h4>
<p>Students embark on a musical journey through singing and playing percussion
instruments, including resonating bells, xylophones, and unpitched percussion.
They develop good singing habits and become more aware of pitch and rhythm
through ensemble playing. The programme introduces a repertoire of songs
from local and global cultures, taught through engaging activities and
singing games.</p>
