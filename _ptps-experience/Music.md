Melody @ Pei Tong consists of various musical activities that encompass studentsâ€™ life in school, aiming to make music an integral part of their school experience.

## Enrichment programmes

Every year, students from each level receive enrichment lessons from music practitioners. They aim to provide authentic learning experiences for students to put their musical skills to use.

## Primary 1 and 2


Students embark on the musical journey through a vocal enrichment program to develop healthy singing habits and to have more awareness of pitch, rhythm, and vocal tone qualities. Students are exposed to a repertoire of songs from local and global cultures, in the context of fun activities and singing games.

## Primary 3


With the foundation of good singing voices established, students then prepare for a musical drama performance. It is an interdisciplinary project providing a platform for students with varied talents to shine. There are opportunities for students to provide input and contribute to writing the script, creating stage props and costumes, choreographing, and other aspects of putting up a stage performance. While students with a flair for drama play the main and supporting characters to act out the scenes, everyone else in the cohort also performs on stage as an ensemble.

## Primary 4 and 5


Students receive coaching to deepen their ukulele playing skills and equip them with the musical capacities to express themselves. They learn to play chords and a variety of strumming patterns. They also learn to read chord diagrams, so that interested students may continue learning new songs on their own after the end of the program.

## Primary 6


Students are trained in simple music arrangement and accompaniment using GarageBand on iPad. Through digital music creation, students have the opportunity to play music using different instruments such as the piano, guitar, strings, and drum set. This builds their music-making capabilities, and is a great platform for students to collaborate with their peers and experience playing in a music band.
