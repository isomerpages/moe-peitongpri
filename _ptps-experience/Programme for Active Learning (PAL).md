<h2>What is PAL?</h2>
<p>PAL lessons offer P1 and P2 students fun, hands-on experiential learning
through a broad range of activities in Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education,
and Visual &amp; Performing Arts. These lessons provide students with opportunities
to discover new interests, develop character, and cultivate social-emotional
competencies. Nurturing curiosity, confidence, and cooperative skills in
students is at the heart of PAL lessons.</p>
<h2>How does PAL look like at Pei Tong?</h2>
