<h3>I’m Possible Programme</h3>

through activities that develop fundamental movement skills, general fitness
and coordination.&nbsp; Through various activities such as Mass Dance,

<h3>P3 to P6</h3>
<p>P3 to P6 programmes have a greater emphasis on social awareness and relationship
management skills as they progress towards activities that are more game-specific
and require greater teamwork. Students further develop their gross and
fine motor coordination skills as they participate in activities such as
Inline Skating and Hip Hop. They also participate in alternative sports
such as Kinball and Goalball which require greater teamwork. Other level-based
programmes include P3 Swim Safer, P4 Resilience Walk, P5 Camp Resilience
(Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp), and P6 I’m Possible Sport Engagement.</p>
