# Overview
Sport is an excellent platform to develop character excellence. Activities are planned with a focus on students learning and demonstrating Social and Emotional Learning competencies and school values while being physically active. In particular, Pei Tong’s ACES (Achieving Character Excellence through Sports) Programme drives an emphasis on resilience with the key message of  "I ACE through Sports". It aims to challenge students in both physical and affective aspects through the planned activities throughout the year.

  

Each level of students takes part in various sports activities in a year. The activities are carefully curated to provide students with learning opportunities and experiences beyond the PHE syllabus.

## Lower Primary Sports Day / Sports Carnival


The Lower Primary Sports Day and Sports Carnival is the most highly anticipated event of the year for all students. It is a platform for students to showcase the various skills they have been learning during PE lessons in a friendly competitive setting. The Lower Primary students take part in Sports Day activities that focus on fundamental movement skills and general coordination in relay-style games.

The I’mPossible Week is a Paralympic Education Programme which exposes our students to the Paralympics where they can gain awareness and understanding of disability through sports. Students have the opportunity to learn and play inclusive sports and get to experience Para-sports.

Through the event, we hope to equip students with Paralympic Values of courage, determination, inspiration, and equity to be able to achieve the impossible in their lives.<br>


## ActiveSG


In partnership with ActiveSG, our school conducts activities for students based on community or nationwide events and seasons. In August 2021 as part of our National Day celebrations, we held the Get Active! Star Challenge for students where they could complete tasks and activities both in school and at home to earn themselves a Star Badge. The activities included dancing to the National Day Theme song and coming up with their own sports equipment, and students enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

  

We also held the I’mPossible Buddy Run for our students during PE lessons in conjunction with the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics to support our para-athletes. In the event, students learnt more about the visually impaired and guided-running and took turns to guide each other in the run/walk event to clock a total distance of 130km. Students were awarded a virtual certificate and medal for completing the activity.
