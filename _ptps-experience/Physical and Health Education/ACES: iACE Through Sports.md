# Overview
Sport is an excellent platform to develop character excellence. Activities are planned with a focus on students learning and demonstrating Social and Emotional Learning competencies and school values while being physically active. In particular, Pei Tong’s ACES (Achieving Character Excellence through Sports) Programme drives an emphasis on resilience with the key message of  "I ACE through Sports". It aims to challenge students in both physical and affective aspects through the planned activities throughout the year.

  

Each level of students takes part in various sports activities in a year. The activities are carefully curated to provide students with learning opportunities and experiences beyond the PHE syllabus.

## Lower Primary Sports Day / Sports Carnival


The Lower Primary Sports Day and Sports Carnival is the most highly anticipated event of the year for all students. It is a platform for students to showcase the various skills they have been learning during PE lessons in a friendly competitive setting. The Lower Primary students take part in Sports Day activities that focus on fundamental movement skills and general coordination in relay-style games.

The Upper Primary students take part in Sports Carnival activities that focus on sports play and skills with each level playing different sports. Students have the opportunity to display values such as sportsmanship, teamwork and resilience while fostering class and school camedarie. 

## I’mPossible

The I’mPossible Week is a Paralympic Education Programme which exposes our students to the Paralympics where they can gain awareness and understanding of disability through sports. Students have the opportunity to learn and play inclusive sports and get to experience Para-sports.

Through the event, we hope to equip students with Paralympic Values of courage, determination, inspiration, and equity to be able to achieve the impossible in their lives.<br><br>


## ActiveSG


In partnership with ActiveSG, our school conducts activities for students based on community or nationwide events and seasons. In August 2021 as part of our National Day celebrations, we held the Get Active! Star Challenge for students where they could complete tasks and activities both in school and at home to earn themselves a Star Badge. The activities included dancing to the National Day Theme song and coming up with their own sports equipment, and students enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

  

We also held the I’mPossible Buddy Run for our students during PE lessons in conjunction with the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics to support our para-athletes. In the event, students learnt more about the visually impaired and guided-running and took turns to guide each other in the run/walk event to clock a total distance of 130km. Students were awarded a virtual certificate and medal for completing the activity.

# ACES Primary 1 and 2

The P1 and P2 programmes focus on fitness, general coordination and fundamental movement. They are integrated with the DISCOVER traits for students to learn self-awareness and self-management, to be able to demonstrate positive values and learning dispositions.

## Mass Dance


The P1 and P2 students will learn a dance choreographed and led by our own teachers. Through dance, they will learn to listen and groove to the beat, as well as create some creative moves of their own. This is a great avenue for them to grow in self-awareness of their bodies.

## Mini Trampoline (iBounce)


The mini trampoline program hopes to acquaint students with different endurance exercises in a fun and informal setting. They will learn to land with proper technique on uneven surfaces. This program incorporates resilience and discipline in a fun way.

# ACES Primary 3 to 6

P3 to P6 programmes progress from lower primary to focus on gross and fine motor coordination and game skills. Students also learn basic survival skills and fitness. Students grow in social skills and relationship management as they participate in activities that require greater teamwork.

## P3 Swimsafer

As part of the P3 PHE Syllabus, the Swimsafer Programme aims to equip students with basic swimming skills for water survival. Students have the opportunity to develop their swimming skills further at their own pace in a fun yet safe manner. This is also an avenue for students to cultivate self-discipline and sportsmanship.

## P3 Inline Skating
This programme covers the fundamentals of inline skating to ensure that students learn it the proper, safe and fun way. Through progressive exercises and drills to help students perform skating skills, students will learn and understand the value of setting goals in small steps, hard work and resilience.

## P4 Kin-Ball

Kin-Ball is an unusual game that has been recently introduced, as it is played with three teams, all competing against each other to win at the same time. The nature of Kin-Ball requires a great deal of teamwork, integrity and some level of fitness due to the fast-paced nature of the game. It is an excellent opportunity for students to learn how to cooperate with each other and to display school values.  

## P4 Resilience Walk

![](/images/PTPS%20Experience/Physical%20and%20Health%20Education/resil%20walk.png)

Annually, P4 students embark on a 4km walk from the school to West Coast Park to conclude their year before promoting to P5 - “Resilience”. Through the Resilience Walk, we aim to foster resilience in our students and educate them to be socially and environmentally conscious when using shared spaces. Students will also have opportunities to bond and strengthen friendships as they then engage in outdoor activities and play at the park. As students are also taught healthy eating in school, we also encourage students to demonstrate their learning by bringing healthy snacks for a short picnic at the park.

## P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp

![](/images/PTPS%20Experience/Physical%20and%20Health%20Education/camp1.jpg)

The signature 3 Day P5 camp aims to cultivate school values such as resilience in students as they get to nurture their outdoor skills, knowledge and attitudes in an authentic context. The objectives of these programmes are basic survival skills, fitness, gross and fine motor coordination, games skills and concepts.

![](/images/PTPS%20Experience/Physical%20and%20Health%20Education/aces%20-camp.png)

Through challenges experienced in an unfamiliar setting, we hope for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies, foster teamwork, and forge strong bonds with their classmates to become a tightly-knitted P5 cohort.

## P6 Post-PSLE Activities


The sporting highlight for P6 Students after their exams is the I’mPossible Para-sport Engagement session that is held during the I’mPossible Week. P6 students get to learn and play with Para-athletes in a para-sport such as Wheelchair basketball, badminton, and Cerebral Palsy Football. It is an eye-opening experience for students as they get inspired by the attitudes and achievements of the Para-athletes.

P6 students also learn Hip Hop moves and grooves. With assisted choreography from dance instructors, the classes learn and practice their own class dance to perform at their P6 Graduation Event. It is a wonderful way for our P6 students to conclude their Primary School journey.
