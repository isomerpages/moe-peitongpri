# Overview

At Pei Tong, we believe in providing a holistic experience for every child. Co-curricular Activities (CCA) allow our students to discover their interests and talents outside of classrooms and promotes interactions and friendships among students from diverse backgrounds. 

Through CCA, discover more about themselves - their strengths, their values, their ability to rise up to challenges and to stretch beyond their ‘limits’.  All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are encouraged to participate in a CCA.
