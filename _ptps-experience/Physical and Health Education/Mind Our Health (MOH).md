The aim of this workshop is for students to understand the importance of good heart health through knowing their BP numbers, making healthier food choices, leading an active lifestyle, and finally advocating a healthy lifestyle by sharing BP information with their family. Students get to bring home a BP monitor for a day to share their knowledge and skills with their families. (Dependent on SMM situation)
