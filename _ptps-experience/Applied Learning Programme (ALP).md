# Overview of PLANE

**PLANET (Pei Tong Learn And Nurture the Environment)**, adopts STEM as its strand and Sustainability for its contextual theme. Coding is one of the key approaches to teaching students computational thinking as it is part of problem solving.

## Tier 1
Students work in teams in Change Maker projects to solve real-life problems and develop solution prototypes (where applicable). They use the design thinking approach (Feel, Imagine, Do, Share).

## Tier 2
Interested students can participate in co-curricular activities (CCAs), such as the Environmental Science Club and the InfoComm Club. These clubs enable students to participate in initiatives to promote sustainable practices in the school community.
