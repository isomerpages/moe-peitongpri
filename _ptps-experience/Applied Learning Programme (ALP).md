## Tier 1
Students work in teams in Change Maker projects to solve real-life problems and develop solution prototypes (where applicable). They use a 4 step (Feel, Imagine, Do, Share) Design for Change approach. 

## Tier 2
Interested students can participate in co-curricular activities (CCAs), such as the Environmental Science Club and the InfoComm Club. These clubs enable students to participate in initiatives to promote sustainable practices in the school community.
