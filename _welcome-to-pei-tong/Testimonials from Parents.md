## What our Parents have to say

To be honest, my child entered Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS) through registration phase 2Cs as she was balloted out from another school. Coming in, I did not hope for much and just want her to make friends, have fun and enjoy her childhood. 

  

To my pleasant surprise, PTPS has far exceeded all my expectations. During the first day of school, there were so many helpful teachers around and even the Principal herself came around to chitchat with us and gave us the assurance that our child is in good hands. 

  

My child’s form teacher, Ms Grace Lee, is nurturing, and patient and sees the best in every student. She makes sure that students get a fair and equal chance at leadership positions and awards. What I really love is how the school seizes every opportunity to reward the students by celebrating every achievement, no matter how small. 

  

All in all, I always believe that everything happens for a reason and I am so thankful that my child is happy and thriving in PTPS. Thank you to all teachers and staff of PTPS, and as an added bonus, the canteen serves amazing curry rice!

Our son Ryan Tan Zhiwen is a graduate of Pei Tong Primary and is currently in Secondary 3 at Commonwealth Secondary.  Our daughter Katelyn Tan Hui Qi currently attends Pei Tong Primary.

  

There are many things we can share about Pei Tong like how well it is managed and how good the school facilities are, but what I believe the school should be most proud of is its staff.  

  

It may sound cliche but the teachers really care for their students in Pei Tong. 'Care' means they go out of their way to ensure each child feels comfortable in the school environment so that they are able to thrive. In P3, Ryan had a rough time with school, he could not get along with some classmates and was very affected by the mean things they would say about him. To the point of refusing to leave the house to go to school and finally coaxing/dragging him out and only getting in at 10 am. This was not a one-time occurrence but almost a daily ritual for 2 weeks. As parents, calling this stressful was an understatement. 

  

The teachers at PTPS, Mrs Chan and Mr Liow reached out to us and organised meetings after school hours with us and Ryan to try to understand what was causing this distress. They then proceeded to send video messages and texts addressed to Ryan to encourage him to return to school and to make sure he felt comfortable and safe. They waited at the lobby each morning to meet him when he arrived at school and even gave him extra lessons so he could catch up. It took time and patience but Ryan started going back to school.

  

His teachers in P4, P5 and P6 also played a crucial role during these formative years. Always patiently correcting his behaviour when needed, intervening when there were conflicts between peers, praising him when he deserved it and even sharing stories of their personal life experiences. 

  

Ryan had no problems with his PSLE and has fond memories of primary school. This is all due to the tireless efforts of his teachers. Mrs Chan, Mrs Yeo-Ng, Mr Kevin Chua, Mr Chin, Mr Liow and all Ryan's teachers over the years, we thank you for all you have done for him and I'm sure, all the other students as well.

Sending my 2 girls to Pei Tong brings back fond memories as I was a former student of Pei Tong Primary. When Pei Tong moved to the new Clementi campus in 1981, my family had also just moved into Clementi new housing estate.  Hence, my 3 younger brothers and I all studied in Pei Tong.

  

When my siblings and I have kids, like all parents, we wanted to send our kids to the top academic schools.  However, I realised that Pei Tong has a rich history of heritage and decided to enrol my kids in Pei Tong.  It is also the sense of belonging and returning home.  Belonging to the same school opens up conversations between parents and kids as I was able to share with them what I did in school and the little corners where I used to play although the school building has been redeveloped.  These shared memories fascinated the children as they were able to relate to my stories and we can all see the changes that evolved in Pei Tong.  They were proud to be in the same school as their father and were happy to let their friends and teachers know about this!

  

Pei Tong is a school that provides a holistic and nurturing environment for children.  It is not a “high-pressure cooker” school where chasing after grades is more important than developing the children.  When we pick up our kids from school, we can see the children laughing and chatting with each other when they are dismissed from school.  This is in stark contrast to other top academic schools where we noticed the children are sombre and tired of excessive homework. Pei Tong allows the children to develop and discover their passion and interests through various CCAs and programmes.  I am indeed proud to be an alumnus of Pei Tong and even prouder that my children will also be Pei Tong alumni.  I hope that Pei Tong continues to maintain this nurturing environment as it is such that children can maintain their curiosity in learning and discover their talents, and not be bogged down by the continuous chase after grades.

My children are from the graduating classes of 2016 and 2019. My children are very privileged to have very supportive teachers and staff who have encouraged them both emotionally and academically in their 6 years in Pei Tong.

  

The teachers had given feedback on suitable academic paths (IB path for my son at primary 4) and encouraged him through efforts such as providing feedback for his exams and extra classes so that he could attain the grades to allow him to get into the SJI integrated programme. He had made strong friendships that lasted even 5 years after leaving the school. 

  

On non-academic pursuit, my daughter had always been allowed to do interschool games for artistic gymnastics as a lone athlete. This took up many resources from the school in both time and management. The PE department made little notes of encouragement for her prior to each competition.  Kudos to the vice-principal then for coming to support her during the prize-giving ceremony as well. My girl is currently in the integrated programme at SCGS. 

  

Pei Tong is like an extended family to us. We are indebted to and very grateful to everyone who has made the primary school journey a smooth and wholesome experience.

Our daughter, Lim HuaMing, Nicole, graduated from Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS) in the Year 2020. We have seen many new changes to PTPS over the years with all of them making a positive impact on our child's learning and development. The school is very well supported within the community, and it offers a wide range of opportunities for children to learn.  

  

The year 2020 had been a challenging year, especially for the P6 graduating cohort who were taking their first national examinations in a pandemic year where two months of school comprised home-based learning. During that period, her teachers never failed to give their support, guidance and encouragement. Thank you so much, teachers! Nicole passed her PSLE examinations with flying colours and she also received a confirmed offer for six years IP Programme via the DSA-Sec Exercise.

  

The character that she developed through her six years of primary education in PTPS has shaped her to be a self-regulated and independent learner. This positive attitude helps her cope well with her secondary school studies.

  

Thank you for making her primary school years so fulfilled and happy. She is proud to be part of Pei Tong family!
