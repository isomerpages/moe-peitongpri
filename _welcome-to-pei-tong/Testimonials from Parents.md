<h1>üì¢ Testimonials from Parents</h1>
<p>My daughter was part of the graduating class of 2023 at Pei Tong Primary
School, and I couldn't be more impressed with the teachers, especially
Mr. Husni and Mr. Chua. Their dedication and professionalism in providing
support and guidance, not only to the children but also to us, the 'gan
cheong' parents, have been truly amazing. They go above and beyond by making
themselves available not just during school hours but also outside typical
school hours.</p>
<p>Since moving on to the next chapter of her education in 2024, there hasn't
been a single day where my daughter hasn't expressed how much she misses
her teachers at Pei Tong. Their impact on her goes beyond the classroom,
and I am deeply grateful for the positive influence they've had on her.</p>

<p>My son had the privilege of being taught by some of the finest educators
during his crucial years in P5 and P6 at Pei Tong Primary School. These
teachers stand out as remarkable educators whose patience, dedication,
and commitment to teaching left a lasting impact on my son's education.</p>
<p>I witnessed firsthand their unwavering dedication to ensuring that every
child understood the lessons thoroughly. Thanks to their guidance, my son
excelled enough to gain entry into a reputable school of his choice. Beyond
imparting knowledge, these teachers instilled valuable values and never
hesitated to discipline with firm yet loving guidance.</p>
<p>In addition to the academic curriculum, his teachers went above and beyond
by sharing personal experiences and setbacks with the students, inspiring
them with stories of resilience and overcoming challenges. One teacher,
in particular, demonstrated musical talents by playing guitar and singing
with the children, and also created engaging educational content to enhance
the learning experience.</p>
<p>My son formed deep connections during his six years at Pei Tong, forging
friendships and building relationships outside our family circle. Despite
moving on after PSLE, he remains in touch with several classmates, highlighting
the strong bonds formed at the school.</p>

<p>To be honest, my child entered Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS) through
registration phase 2Cs as she was balloted out from another school. Coming
in, I did not hope for much and just want her to make friends, have fun
and enjoy her childhood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, PTPS has far exceeded all my expectations. During
the first day of school, there were so many helpful teachers around and
even the Principal herself came around to chitchat with us and gave us
the assurance that our child is in good hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My child‚Äôs form teacher, Ms Grace Lee, is nurturing, and patient and sees
the best in every student. She makes sure that students get a fair and
equal chance at leadership positions and awards. What I really love is
how the school seizes every opportunity to reward the students by celebrating
every achievement, no matter how small.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I always believe that everything happens for a reason, and
I am so thankful that my child is happy and thriving in PTPS. Thank you
to all teachers and staff of PTPS, and as an added bonus, the canteen serves
amazing curry rice!</p>

<p>Our son Ryan Tan Zhiwen is a graduate of Pei Tong Primary and is currently
in Secondary 3 at Commonwealth Secondary.&nbsp; Our daughter Katelyn Tan
Hui Qi currently attends Pei Tong Primary.</p>
<p>There are many things we can share about Pei Tong like how well it is
managed and how good the school facilities are, but what I believe the
school should be most proud of is its staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may sound cliche, but the teachers really care for their students in
Pei Tong. 'Care' means they go out of their way to ensure each child feels
comfortable in the school environment so that they are able to thrive.
In P3, Ryan had a rough time with school, he could not get along with some
classmates and was very affected by the mean things they would say about
him. To the point of refusing to leave the house to go to school and finally
coaxing/dragging him out and only getting in at 10 am. This was not a one-time
occurrence but almost a daily ritual for 2 weeks. As parents, calling this
stressful was an understatement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The teachers at PTPS, Mrs Chan and Mr Liow reached out to us and organised
meetings after school hours with us and Ryan to try to understand what
was causing this distress. They then proceeded to send video messages and
texts addressed to Ryan to encourage him to return to school and to make
sure he felt comfortable and safe. They waited at the lobby each morning
to meet him when he arrived at school and even gave him extra lessons so
he could catch up. It took time and patience, but Ryan started going back
to school.</p>
<p>His teachers in P4, P5 and P6 also played a crucial role during these
formative years. Always patiently correcting his behaviour when needed,
intervening when there were conflicts between peers, praising him when
he deserved it and even sharing stories of their personal life experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan had no problems with his PSLE and has fond memories of primary school.
This is all due to the tireless efforts of his teachers. Mrs Chan, Mrs
Yeo-Ng, Mr Kevin Chua, Mr Chin, Mr Liow and all Ryan's teachers over the
years, we thank you for all you have done for him and I'm sure, all the
other students as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sending my 2 girls to Pei Tong brings back fond memories as I was a former
student of Pei Tong Primary. When Pei Tong moved to the new Clementi campus
in 1981, my family had also just moved into Clementi new housing estate.&nbsp;
Hence, my 3 younger brothers and I all studied in Pei Tong.</p>
<p>When my siblings and I have kids, like all parents, we wanted to send
our kids to the top academic schools.&nbsp; However, I realised that Pei
Tong has a rich history of heritage and decided to enrol my kids in Pei
Tong.&nbsp; It is also the sense of belonging and returning home.&nbsp;
Belonging to the same school opens up conversations between parents and
kids as I was able to share with them what I did in school and the little
corners where I used to play although the school building has been redeveloped.&nbsp;
These shared memories fascinated the children as they were able to relate
to my stories and we can all see the changes that evolved in Pei Tong.&nbsp;
They were proud to be in the same school as their father and were happy
to let their friends and teachers know about this!</p>
<p>Pei Tong is a school that provides a holistic and nurturing environment
for children.&nbsp; It is not a ‚Äúhigh-pressure cooker‚Äù school where chasing
after grades is more important than developing the children.&nbsp; When
we pick up our kids from school, we can see the children laughing and chatting
with each other when they are dismissed from school.&nbsp; This is in stark
contrast to other top academic schools where we noticed the children are
sombre and tired of excessive homework. Pei Tong allows the children to
develop and discover their passion and interests through various CCAs and
programmes.&nbsp; I am indeed proud to be an alumnus of Pei Tong and even
prouder that my children will also be Pei Tong alumni.&nbsp; I hope that
Pei Tong continues to maintain this nurturing environment as it is such
that children can maintain their curiosity in learning and discover their
talents, and not be bogged down by the continuous chase after grades.</p>

<p>My children are from the graduating classes of 2016 and 2019. My children
are very privileged to have very supportive teachers and staff who have
encouraged them both emotionally and academically in their 6 years in Pei
Tong.</p>
<p>The teachers had given feedback on suitable academic paths (IB path for
my son at primary 4) and encouraged him through efforts such as providing
feedback for his exams and extra classes so that he could attain the grades
to allow him to get into the SJI integrated programme. He had made strong
friendships that lasted even 5 years after leaving the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On non-academic pursuit, my daughter had always been allowed to do interschool
games for artistic gymnastics as a lone athlete. This took up many resources
from the school in both time and management. The PE department made little
notes of encouragement for her prior to each competition.&nbsp; Kudos to
the vice-principal then for coming to support her during the prize-giving
ceremony as well. My girl is currently in the integrated programme at SCGS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pei Tong is like an extended family to us. We are indebted to and very
grateful to everyone who has made the primary school journey a smooth and
wholesome experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our daughter, Lim HuaMing, Nicole, graduated from Pei Tong Primary School
(PTPS) in the Year 2020. We have seen many new changes to PTPS over the
years with all of them making a positive impact on our child's learning
and development. The school is very well supported within the community,
and it offers a wide range of opportunities for children to learn.</p>
<p>The year 2020 had been a challenging year, especially for the P6 graduating
cohort who were taking their first national examinations in a pandemic
year where two months of school comprised home-based learning. During that
period, her teachers never failed to give their support, guidance and encouragement.
Thank you so much, teachers! Nicole passed her PSLE examinations with flying
colours and she also received a confirmed offer for six years IP Programme
via the DSA-Sec Exercise.</p>
<p>The character that she developed through her six years of primary education
in PTPS has shaped her to be a self-regulated and independent learner.
This positive attitude helps her cope well with her secondary school studies.</p>
<p>Thank you for making her primary school years so fulfilled and happy.
She is proud to be part of Pei Tong family!</p>
