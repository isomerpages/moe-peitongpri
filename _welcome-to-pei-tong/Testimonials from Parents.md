## What our Parents have to say

To be honest, my child entered Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS) through registration phase 2Cs as she was balloted out from another school. Coming in, I did not hope for much and just want her to make friends, have fun and enjoy her childhood.Â 

  

To my pleasant surprise, PTPS has far exceeded all my expectations. During the first day of school, there were so many helpful teachers around and even the Principal herself came around to chitchat with us and gave us the assurance that our child is in good hands.Â 

  

My childâ€™s form teacher, Ms Grace Lee, is nurturing, and patient and sees the best in every student. She makes sure that students get a fair and equal chance at leadership positions and awards. What I really love is how the school seizes every opportunity to reward the students by celebrating every achievement, no matter how small.Â 

  

All in all, I always believe that everything happens for a reason and I am so thankful that my child is happy and thriving in PTPS. Thank you to all teachers and staff of PTPS, and as an added bonus, the canteen serves amazing curry rice!

## What our Parents have to say

Our son Ryan Tan Zhiwen is a graduate of Pei Tong Primary and is currently in Secondary 3 at Commonwealth Secondary.Â  Our daughter Katelyn Tan Hui Qi currently attends Pei Tong Primary.

  

There are many things we can share about Pei Tong like how well it is managed and how good the school facilities are, but what I believe the school should be most proud of is its staff.Â Â 

  

It may sound cliche but the teachers really care for their students in Pei Tong. 'Care' means they go out of their way to ensure each child feels comfortable in the school environment so that they are able to thrive. In P3, Ryan had a rough time with school, he could not get along with some classmates and was very affected by the mean things they would say about him. To the point of refusing to leave the house to go to school and finally coaxing/dragging him out and only getting in at 10 am. This was not a one-time occurrence but almost a daily ritual for 2 weeks. As parents, calling this stressful was an understatement.Â 

  

The teachers at PTPS, Mrs Chan and Mr Liow reached out to us and organised meetings after school hours with us and Ryan to try to understand what was causing this distress. They then proceeded to send video messages and texts addressed to Ryan to encourage him to return to school and to make sure he felt comfortable and safe. They waited at the lobby each morning to meet him when he arrived at school and even gave him extra lessons so he could catch up. It took time and patience but Ryan started going back to school.

  

His teachers in P4, P5 and P6 also played a crucial role during these formative years. Always patiently correcting his behaviour when needed, intervening when there were conflicts between peers, praising him when he deserved it and even sharing stories of their personal life experiences.Â 

  

Ryan had no problems with his PSLE and has fond memories of primary school. This is all due to the tireless efforts of his teachers. Mrs Chan, Mrs Yeo-Ng, Mr Kevin Chua, Mr Chin, Mr Liow and all Ryan's teachers over the years, we thank you for all you have done for him and I'm sure, all the other students as well.Â Â
