<p>Welcome to Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS), where we are committed to nurturing
every child to be passionate learner, a resilient individual, and a gracious
citizen. 2025 marks a significant milestone as we celebrate our 80th anniversary.
Our journey since 1945 reflects not just our heritage, but our unwavering
dedication to nurturing generations of students who embody our vision.</p>
<p>At PTPS, we believe that education goes beyond textbooks and examinations.
Our mission of nurturing students to be future-ready and rooted in values
guides everything we do. This philosophy has served us well in our journey
of educational excellence and continues to be our compass as we prepare
our students for an ever-evolving world.</p>
<p>Our dedicated educators create dynamic learning environments where students
develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and a genuine love for learning.
Through innovative teaching approaches and meaningful learning experiences,
we encourage our students to be curious, to question, and to explore.</p>
<p>The foundation of our school rests upon our core values of care, respect,
integrity, responsibility, resilience, and excellence. These values have
been our cornerstone through the decades and continue to shape our students'
character. They are not just words on a wall â€“ they are lived experiences
in our classrooms, corridors, and beyond. We believe that by embodying
these values, our students develop the character strength needed to navigate
life's challenges successfully.</p>
<p>Our partnership with parents and the community has been crucial to our
80-year journey. Together, we create a supportive environment where children
feel safe to explore, make mistakes, learn, and grow. This collaborative
approach ensures that our students receive consistent guidance both at
home and in school, continuing a tradition of strong home-school-community
partnership that has defined PTPS since its establishment.</p>
<p>At PTPS, every child matters. We recognise and celebrate the unique talents
and potential in each student. Whether in the classroom, on the sports
field, or in the arts studio, we provide opportunities for every child
to discover their strengths and pursue their passions. This commitment
to holistic development has been our hallmark.</p>
<p>As we celebrate this milestone year, I invite you to be part of our continuing
legacy of excellence in education and character building. Together, we
can nurture our children into confident, capable individuals who will make
positive contributions to society, just as generations of PTPS alumni have
done before them.</p>
<p><strong>Together Towards Tomorrow, let us all walk this journey.</strong>
