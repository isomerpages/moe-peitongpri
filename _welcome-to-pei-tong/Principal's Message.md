**Let me first start off by wishing everyone a great start to 2023!**

  

I am indeed honoured and delighted to continue the Pei Tong story.Â 

  

Under the leadership of Mrs Ng-Teo Sock Hua, Pei Tong has lived up to the vision of nurturing every child to be a passionate learner, resilient individual and gracious citizen. On behalf of our staff and stakeholders, I would like to take this opportunity to wish Mrs Ng the best in her new undertakings as Principal of Yumin Primary.

  

As the newest member of the Pei Tong family, I am pleased to note that the school has established unique programmes such as the Enriched Total Curriculum (PETC), Talent Programme (TP@PTPS), Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), as well as the PT Heartbeat Publications. Moving forward, I will continue to transform and grow with Pei Tong, in her endeavor and strive for educational excellence.Â 

  

As mentioned by Minister Chan, education will continue to be a social leveller for Singapore for generations to come. For this to be possible, teachers will be the key to deliver this promise, for our students to rise to their fullest potential regardless of background, race or religion. Lifelong education is of paramount importance, and we hold that key to imbue the passion for learning, unlearning and relearning to take place.Â Â 

  

Therefore, as the eleventh principal of the 78-year-old school, I am also committed to carry on the good work made possible by the team of experienced and committed staff. Together, we will continue to plan and implement programmes that can nurture and inspire our students to be holistic and engaged learners who are future ready and anchored in values.Â 

  

Hereâ€™s to a successful 2023 and beyond. Thank you.Â
