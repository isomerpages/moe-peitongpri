Welcome to Pei Tong Primary School (PTPS), a place where every child is valued and nurtured to become a passionate learner, a resilient individual, and a gracious citizen. Guided by our school motto, “We Look Ahead,” we remain committed to providing a holistic education that prepares our students for life beyond the classroom.

At PTPS, we believe that education is not only about academic achievement, but also about developing character, confidence, and purpose. Our mission to nurture future-ready learners rooted in strong values shapes our approach to teaching and learning. As the world continues to evolve rapidly, we strive to equip our students with critical thinking skills, creativity, adaptability, and a love for lifelong learning.

Our dedicated and caring educators play a vital role in this journey. Through engaging lessons, meaningful experiences, and thoughtful guidance, they create a positive learning environment where students are encouraged to be curious, ask questions, and explore new ideas. Learning at PTPS is purposeful, joyful, and designed to help every child grow at their own pace.

Central to our school culture are our school values of care, respect, integrity, responsibility, resilience, and excellence. These values guide our daily interactions and decision-making, helping our students develop strong character and a sense of responsibility towards others. At PTPS, values are not merely taught — they are lived and experienced through everyday moments in school.

Student well-being is at the heart of all that we do. Guided by our Positive Education and PERMAH framework (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment and health), we are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment where students feel a sense of belonging, purpose, and joy in learning. When students are emotionally well, they are better able to thrive academically and socially.

We deeply value our partnership with parents and the wider community. Working closely together, we provide consistent support and guidance for our children, strengthening the connection between home and school. This shared commitment plays an important role in nurturing confident and well-rounded learners.

As we look ahead, we remain optimistic and steadfast in our mission. Together, let us continue to support and inspire our children as they grow into capable individuals who will contribute meaningfully to society.
