<p><em>Pei Tong Primary School holds a special place in my heart, and I am incredibly grateful for the experiences and lessons I gained here. Now, as a student at Nanyang Girls' High, I often reflect on my time at Pei Tong and the wonderful memories I created with my friends and teachers.</em>

</div>
<p><em>These values have guided me in everything I do, whether it’s helping friends with schoolwork, expressing gratitude to those around me, or striving to do my best in all my endeavors.</em>
</p>
<p><em>One of the most important lessons I learned at Pei Tong is to embrace my unique strengths and not compare myself to others. A story that has always stuck with me is about a farmer and his two buckets—one with holes and one perfect. The imperfect bucket, despite leaking water, helped flowers and grass flourish along the path. This story taught me that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and what may seem like a weakness can sometimes be a strength in a different situation. This mindset has helped me focus on my growth and take pride in my abilities.</em>
</p>
<p><em>I am deeply grateful for the guidance of my teachers, especially my Primary 6 teachers, Mr. Husni, Mr. Chua, and 谢老师, who supported me throughout my journey at Pei Tong.</em>

<p>I am a proud graduate of Pei Tong Primary School from the class of 2022,
currently pursuing my studies at NUS High School of Mathematics and Science.</p>
<p>During my six-year academic journey at Pei Tong, I had the privilege of
learning from dedicated teachers and alongside supportive peers. These
invaluable experiences have significantly contributed to the development
of my character and leadership qualities.</p>
<p>As Pei Tong students, we uphold six core values: Care, Respect, Integrity,
Responsibility, Resilience, and Excellence. These values have not only
shaped my character but also instilled in me a sense of social awareness,
pride in my work, and a commitment to kindness towards others.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable aspects of my time at Pei Tong was my leadership
journey. It began in Primary 3 when I was nominated as a junior prefect,
providing me with opportunities to develop essential leadership skills
through duty roles and training sessions. In Primary 5, I was honored to
be nominated as Vice-Head Prefect through the Head Prefect Election process.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>I am also immensely grateful for the unwavering support and guidance provided
by my teachers, especially during challenging times such as the COVID-19
Circuit Breaker period.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/testimonial_quote__1_.png">

<p>Overall, my experience at Pei Tong has not only enriched my academic knowledge
but also imparted valuable life lessons and moral values. I am deeply thankful
for the supportive environment and dedicated teachers who have played a
significant role in shaping me into the person I am today.</p>

<p>Pei Tong is special to me because it is a place where we students can
enjoy, play, study and make new friends. It is also a place where care
is readily provided whenever we need it.</p>

<p>Another special teacher I remember fondly is my Primary 6 math teacher,
Mrs Yeo. Math was difficult, but she ensured that we learned well as we
prepared for PSLE.</p>

<p>Now that I am in Hua Yi Secondary School, I look back and am incredibly
grateful to them for their patience and how they have played an important
part to shape me into who I am today. As I recall these fond memories now,
how I wish I could return to Pei Tong and reunite with my friends and teachers
soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to the teachers and staff who have done so much for me, and
I really hope to be able to see all of you again soon!</p>

<p>Pei Tong has given me a conducive environment and opportunities to succeed,
learn new skills, as well as make new friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back when I was in Primary 3, initially I wanted to join badminton as
a CCA.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I later discovered that I had asthma and hence
the chance to join badminton was gone.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/testimonial_quote__6_.png">

<p>My passion for Erhu grew and led me to take extra lessons outside school.
Later, I even applied for Direct School Admission to Nan Hua High through
playing the Erhu to further my passion in this instrument in secondary
school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pei Tong has offered many different platforms to showcase our raw talents
and interests too. For example, the yearly “Pei Tong’s Got Talent” contest
organised by the Parent Support Group was the most highly anticipated event
for students. I fondly remembered my younger sister and I were fortunate
to be able to pass the numerous auditions and took part in the finals which
we eventually emerged as champion. These events have helped to build up
confidence in students in their area of interest.</p>
<p>Throughout primary school, I was a quiet student who was afraid of public
speaking and was low in confidence. Despite being someone who was just
in the background, my form teacher Mr Liow selected me as a junior prefect
in Primary 3. He probably saw the potential in me which I was not aware
of.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/testimonial_quote__7_.png">
</div>
<p>Their guidance was instrumental in my journey as they taught me to step
up, show initiative, and develop leadership and organising skills so as
to be able to work well in a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidance and opportunities that have been offered by my teachers certainly
developed my character in my formative years. My teachers were caring and
highly involved in ensuring the students’ development. Without these opportunities
and guidance that the school has offered in its nurturing environment,
I would not have been the person that I am today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pei Tong is special to me because when I moved to the west side of Singapore,
I did not have many friends. Pei Tong has helped me meet new people whom
I am still friends with till this day.</p>
<p>During one of my most stressful time leading to PSLE, my Pei Tong and
CDAC teachers supported me and helped me with my studies. As such, I managed
to pass PSLE with flying colours.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/testimonial_quote__3_.png">

<p>I do have many fond memories of Pei Tong. Other than the classroom lessons,
I remembered we had a bouncy castle for quite a few of our Children's Day
celebrations organised by our Parents' Support Group. There was also our
school’s 70th anniversary carnival which I enjoyed a lot. Even the 1.6
km run out at the Ulu Pandan Canal, which was part of our NAPFA test, was
fun and memorable, as we completed it in the company of friends and teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thankful for my learning experience in Pei Tong and I would like
to go back to visit the school when this Covid-19 situation improves.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Pei Tong Primary School has played a pivotal role in shaping who I am
today, both as a student and as a person. When I joined Pei Tong in Primary
5, I faced many challenges as I adjusted to a new language, culture, and
education system. Coming from China, where the education system and language
were very different, I found it daunting to keep up with my lessons in
English. But over time, I realised that Pei Tong taught me something invaluable:
resilience. The school’s core values of resilience, care, and excellence
helped me face every challenge head-on, knowing that every difficulty was
an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What truly made a difference at Pei Tong was the sense of community. I
never had to face challenges alone. Whether it was tackling a difficult
subject or managing personal hurdles, I always felt supported by my teachers
and friends. The core value of care is not just a concept—it’s lived out
every day in the school’s culture. I am especially grateful to teachers
like Mr. Chua and Mr. Husni, who helped me excel in subjects like Science
and English. Their patience and support encouraged me to believe in my
abilities and helped me overcome challenges that once seemed impossible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the most rewarding experiences at Pei Tong was discovering my passion
for competitive mathematics. Through the Math Olympiad, I learned that
excellence isn’t just about achieving the highest marks—it’s about pushing
yourself to constantly improve. This experience has been a source of great
joy and fulfillment, and it’s something I’ll carry with me for the rest
of my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am incredibly grateful to Pei Tong for the lessons it has taught me
and the memories it has given me. To my juniors, I encourage you to embrace
every challenge, seek support when needed, and never stop discovering what
excites you. With the guidance and care of this wonderful school, I know
you’ll thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you, Pei Tong, for being such an important part of my journey.</p>

<p>Amidst the various experiences that have influenced my character, my time
at Pei Tong Primary School (Pei Tong) holds a special significance. Pei
Tong is a nurturing environment where achievements are celebrated, and
mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth. It's a place where care,
respect, and social responsibility are deeply ingrained, fostering an atmosphere
of trust and integrity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, Pei Tong provides ample opportunities for students to challenge
themselves and develop resilience while striving for excellence. These
core values of care, respect, integrity, responsibility, resilience, and
excellence are not just taught but embodied by every Pei Tong student,
shaping them into capable leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reflecting on my journey at Pei Tong, I am reminded of the dedicated teachers
who have played a pivotal role in creating such a supportive environment.
Despite facing challenges, they have worked tirelessly to ensure our success.
Though I couldn't attend Teachers' Day this year due to the school being
used as a polling center, I am grateful for this opportunity to express
my heartfelt appreciation to all my teachers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Special thanks to my Primary 6 form teachers, Mr. Li and Mdm. Teo, for
their invaluable guidance on staying motivated and resilient. My Tamil
Teacher, Mdm. Kanmani, always imparted important life lessons with her
teachings, inspiring us to be our best selves. And of course, Ms. Sim,
my Mathematics teacher, motivated us to strive for excellence through rewards
and recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am forever grateful for the dedication and support of all my teachers
at Pei Tong. Their passion for teaching has left a lasting impact on my
life, and I am truly fortunate to have been under their guidance.</p>

<p>My experience at Pei Tong Primary School was filled with fond memories
of engaging events and supportive teachers. Looking back, I realize I didn't
fully appreciate everything at the time. However, the patience and encouragement
of our teachers, especially during challenging moments, left a lasting
impression on me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Events like carnivals, Chinese New Year celebrations, and talent shows
provided enjoyable breaks from our studies. Although I was too shy to participate
in talent shows, witnessing my classmates' hard work and achievements was
truly inspiring. I also have fond memories of participating in various
recess activities during festive occasions and commemorative events.</p>

<p>As I reflect on my time at Pei Tong, I'm grateful for the positive experiences
and supportive community. I hope that future students will also have the

<p>Teachers and counsellors in Pei Tong are nice and friendly. Teachers work

<p>I was a part of the badminton CCA team. It was a fun experience that taught
