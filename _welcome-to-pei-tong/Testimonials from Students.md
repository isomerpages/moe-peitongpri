Pei Tong is a special school to me as it is a place that holds many precious memories for me.¬†  

  

The teachers work hard and try their best to make their lessons as fun as possible despite having many classes to teach. The non-teaching staff working at the school are also friendly and helpful, always willing to lend a hand to any student in need.¬†

  

I was in the Chinese Orchestra and I am thankful for the coaches and teachers who prepared us well for the various performances and competitions, which have helped us to develop in other areas besides our studies.

  

Now that I am in secondary school, I miss the school and all my teachers and classmates who have taught and helped me throughout the years I have spent there. I am grateful for everything that the school has done for me.¬†

  

Thank you to all my teachers and staff for everything! It was a great and enjoyable experience being at Pei Tong for 6 years!

Pei Tong is special to me because it‚Äôs a place full of memories and a place that made me feel like it was a place where I belonged.¬†  

  

Teachers and counsellors in Pei Tong are nice and friendly. Teachers work very hard to make lessons interesting, fun and easy to understand for students even during the hardest time when the covid pandemic started.

  

I was a part of the badminton CCA team. It was a fun experience that taught me lots of values like sportsmanship and teamwork. The training was tough but it was where I learned not to give up so easily and persevere in order to be the best I can be. That mindset really helped me through my secondary school life.

  

I‚Äôm also very thankful for the teachers who have been by my side when I was feeling stressed and had difficulties while preparing for PSLE. Thanks to them, I was able to get into the stream of my choice in secondary school.¬†

  

Now that I am in secondary school, I do miss the school, teachers, and even my previous classmates and friends there.¬†

  

Thank you to all teachers and staff for everything that you have done for me! I really hope that I would be able to go back and visit Pei tong soon!

Pei Tong has given me a conducive environment and opportunities to succeed, learn new skills, as well as make new friends.¬†

  

Back when I was in Primary 3, initially I wanted to join badminton as a CCA.¬† Unfortunately, I later discovered that I had asthma and hence the chance to join badminton was gone. However, Pei Tong opened a new door for me as I was selected to join Chinese Orchestra to play the Erhu. The opportunity given by the teachers enabled me to discover a new talent and interest that I had not known before. My passion for Erhu grew and led me to take extra lessons outside school. Later, I even applied for Direct School Admission to Nan Hua High through playing the Erhu to further my passion in this instrument in secondary school.¬†

  

Pei Tong has offered many different platforms to showcase our raw talents and interests too. For example, the yearly ‚ÄúPei Tong‚Äôs Got Talent‚Äù contest organised by the Parent Support Group was the most highly anticipated event for students. I fondly remembered my younger sister and I were fortunate to be able to pass the numerous auditions and took part in the finals which we eventually emerged as champion. These events have helped to build up confidence in students in their area of interest.

  

Throughout primary school, I was a quiet student who was afraid of public speaking and was low in confidence. Despite being someone who was just in the background, my form teacher Mr Liow selected me as a junior prefect in Primary 3. He probably saw the potential in me which I was not aware of.¬† Throughout the years that followed, my teachers believed in me as they gave me the chance to improve my communication skills and confidence in leading and eventually selected me to be in the Prefects Executive Committee. Their guidance was instrumental in my journey as they taught me to step up, show initiative, and develop leadership and organising skills so as to be able to work well in a team.¬†

  

The guidance and opportunities that have been offered by my teachers certainly developed my character in my formative years. My teachers were caring and highly involved in ensuring the students‚Äô development. Without these opportunities and guidance that the school has offered in its nurturing environment, I would not have been the person that I am today.¬†

Pei Tong is special to me because it is a place where we students can enjoy, play, study and make new friends. It is also a place where care is readily provided whenever we need it.  

  

When I was in Primary 1, I was rather mischievous back then. My Primary 1 form teacher, Mr Jonah Lim, was always there for me whenever I got into trouble or when I needed someone. Our friendly school counsellor, Ms Eileen, was also very caring and helpful in guiding me along the way. Despite the challenges, they have all been very lenient and patient toward me.

  

Another special teacher I remember fondly is my Primary 6 math teacher, Mrs Yeo. Math was difficult, but she ensured that we learned well as we prepared for PSLE. On the day we received our PSLE results, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that she had waited along the staircase to find out how we fared. I was touched at that moment when she asked me how I did and whether I was okay.¬†

  

Now that I am in Hua Yi Secondary School, I look back and am incredibly grateful to them for their patience and how they have played an important part to shape me into who I am today. As I recall these fond memories now, how I wish I could return to Pei Tong and reunite with my friends and teachers soon.¬†

  

Thank you to the teachers and staff who have done so much for me, and I really hope to be able to see all of you again soon!

Pei Tong is special to me because when I moved to the west side of Singapore, I did not have many friends. Pei Tong has helped me meet new people whom I am still friends with till this day.

  

During one of my most stressful time leading to PSLE, my Pei Tong and CDAC teachers supported me and helped me with my studies. As such, I manage to pass PSLE with flying colours.¬†

  

Pei Tong has helped me to realise that what I'm doing in school now matters. For example, the various CCE and ECG lessons opened my eyes to the diverse types of jobs which I have never realised existed before, and it has helped me to consider and plan my future properly.¬†

  

I do have many fond memories of Pei Tong. Other than the classroom lessons, I remembered we had a bouncy castle for quite a few of our Children's Day celebrations organised by our Parents' Support Group. There was also our school‚Äôs 70th anniversary carnival which I enjoyed a lot. Even the 1.6 km run out at the Ulu Pandan Canal, which was part of our NAPFA test, was fun and memorable, as we completed it in the company of friends and teachers.¬†

  

I am thankful for my learning experience in Pei Tong and I would like to go back to visit the school when this Covid-19 situation improves.

Pei Tong is special to me as it is a place where many important values had been instilled in me. Pei Tong has many fun, engaging as well as bonding activities and excursions for all the students. Nonetheless, Pei Tong offers a lot of leadership opportunities which allowed me to grow bits by bits from there.¬†

  

Through the experiences in Pei Tong, I had immensely improved from an introvert to an outgoing and confident self. This had helped me in very few days of secondary school as my confidence allowed me to make many new friends across all classes.¬†

  

Every bit of my Pei Tong experience was memorable to me as I am always surrounded by helpful and kind teachers, working staff and my fellow schoolmates.¬† Pei Tong had indeed brought me to greater heights.
