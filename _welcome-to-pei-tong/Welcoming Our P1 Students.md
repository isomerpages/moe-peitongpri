# ðŸ‘‹ Welcoming our P1 students


Here in Pei Tong, our staff and Parent Support Group (PSG) members work hand-in-hand to welcome our Primary 1 students and ensure a smooth transition for them. Here are some moments captured on our first day of school these two years.Â Â

We are mindful that it may difficult for some of our little ones. As such, our staff - teachers, counsellors, principals - are all gathered and ready to help ease the children's fears.

On the first days of school, our P1 students get to know their new friends and teachers in their classrooms.

## Recess time for our P1 students

Buying food on their own for the first time and having their meals in the canteen. Our PSG and staff were present to help our new students transit to this new environment. A new experience for our little ones!

Our P1 students also learn how to clean up after themselves - returning their plates and wiping down their tables.
