# ðŸ‘‹ Welcoming our P1 students


Here in Pei Tong, our staff and parent support group members work hand-in-hand to welcome our Primary 1 students and ensure a smooth transition for them. Here are some moments captured on our first day of school these two years.Â Â 

## The arrival of our P1 students and Parents

We are mindful that it may difficult for some of our little ones. As such, our staff - teachers, counsellors, principals - are all gathered and ready to help ease the children's fears.

# Recess time for our P1 students

Buying food on their own for the first time and having their meals in the canteen. A new experience for our little ones!

Our P1 students also learn how to clean up after themselves - returning their plates and wiping down their tables.
