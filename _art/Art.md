# Art

The aim of art education in Pei Tong is to develop every child to have a life-long interest and appreciation in visual arts by communicating and expressing visually and making meaning through connecting with others.

  

A.R.T for life is a program in Pei Tong which aims to develop all students to appreciate, create and communicate through visual arts.

## A â€“ Appreciate


Using the appropriate thinking routines, students acquire skills and use appropriate vocabulary to discuss and interpret artworks. Exposure to a variety of artworks with different art forms and media allows students to appreciate visual arts better.
