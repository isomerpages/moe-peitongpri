<p>Pei Tong Public School was founded in a little village, known as "Little
Pandan", off Clementi Road and officially registered on 26 Nov 1948. The
school pioneers and villagers furnished a simple attap house on stilts
with chairs and desks for the children to learn. They overcame many challenges
to grow the school from strength to strength, from a simple attap house
to a zinc-roofed wing with four classrooms.</p>

<p>After a long period of negotiation with developers to ensure that the
school building had safe structural and sanitary facilities, Pei Tong Public
School moved into its new premises at 50, Sunset Grove on 28 August 1972.
The new building was officially opened by our School Advisor, Mr Cao Yuyin,
Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education.</p>

a new campus in Avenue 5 Clementi New Town and to be renamed as Pei Tong
Primary School in 1981. A plaque of honour installed in the new Pei Tong
Primary School to commemorate the contributions made by the early pioneers,
