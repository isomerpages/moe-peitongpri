<p>The letters "PT" stand for Pei Tong ( 培童 ) which means nurturing the young.</p>
<p>In addition, the 'PT' stands for 'pupil-teacher' and 'parent-teacher'
relationship where both parents and the school play an important role in
nurturing a child to his/her fullest potential.</p>
<p>Lime green which represents 'progress' is used for the letter 'P' while
turquoise which signifies 'transformation' is applied to the 'T'.</p>
<p>The use of these two colours makes the Pei Tong brand distinctive and
proprietary.</p>

<p>Let us grow in strength and wisdom
<br>With heart and soul, we do our best
<br>We know for sure with good values
<br>We will succeed when put to test.</p>
<p><strong><em>Take courage friends for we are one</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>Respect one another, care for you and me</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>Diligent stead-fast in all that we do</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>This is the path to a bright future.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>To Pei Tong we give honour
<br>We learn and play in healthy ways.
<br>Our country - we cherish and adore
<br>We all pledge to be strong and true.</p>
<p><strong><em>Take courage friends for we are one</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>Respect one another honour our elders</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>Diligent stead-fast in all that we do</em></strong>
<br><strong><em>This is the path to a bright future.</em></strong>
