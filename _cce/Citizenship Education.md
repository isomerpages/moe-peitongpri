# Citizenship Education


## Citizenship Dispositions


In Pei Tong, we hope to develop an understanding and appreciation of Singapore and citizenship in this world of complexity, in our students. National Education (NE) will be anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our students to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation:

  

**A Sense of Belonging**<br>
To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation. 

  

**A Sense of Reality**<br>
To be aware of contemporary realities including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.

  

**A Sense of Hope**<br>
Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.  

  

**A Will to Act**<br>
Ultimately, these citizenship dispositions cultivate the will to act: To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.
