# School Song

**INSERT SCHOOL SONG YOUTUBE VIDEO HERE**

Let us grow in strength and wisdom<br>
With heart and soul, we do our best<br>
We know for sure with good system<br>
We will succeed when put to test.

  

**_Take courage friends for we are one_**<br>
**_Respect one another honour our elders_**<br>
**_Diligent stead-fast in all that we do_**<br>
**_This is the path to a bright future._**

  

To our school we all give honour<br>
We learn and play in healthy ways.<br>
Our country - we cherish and adore<br>
We all pledge to be strong and true.

  

**_Take courage friends for we are one_**<br>
**_Respect one another honour our elders_**<br>
**_Diligent stead-fast in all that we do_**<br>
**_This is the path to a bright future._**

  

Music & Lyrics: Mr David K.S.Lim
