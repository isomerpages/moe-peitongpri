The letters "PT" stand for Pei Tong ( 培童 ) which means nurturing the young.   

  

In addition, the 'PT' stands for 'pupil-teacher' and 'parent-teacher' relationship where both parents and the school play an important role in nurturing a child to his/her fullest potential.

  

Lime green which represents 'progress' is used for the letter 'P' while turquoise which signifies 'transformation' is applied to the 'T'.

  

The use of these two colours makes the Pei Tong brand distinctive and proprietary.
