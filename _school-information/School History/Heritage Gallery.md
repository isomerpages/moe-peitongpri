The gallery features the history of Clementi and our school. There are also nostalgic photographs and items from the past on display. This gallery serves to enrich the learning experience for our students and inculcate a sense of rootedness and belonging to our country.

  
Our students do get to visit this gallery for some of their Social Studies lessons pertaining to our school as well as our community, Clementi. The gallery is also open during our school open house and kindergarten visits.
