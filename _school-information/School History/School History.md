### Tumultuous humble beginnings in the post war era

Pei Tong Public School was founded in a little village, known as "Little Pandan", off Clementi Road and officially registered in 26 Nov 1948.  The school pioneers and villagers furnished a simple attap house on stilts with chairs and desks for the children to learn. They overcame many challenges to grow the school from strength to strength, from a simple attap house to a zinc-roofed wing with four classrooms.

### Our old campus at 50 Sunset Grove

After a long period of negotiation with developers to ensure that the school building had safe structural and sanitary facilities, Pei Tong Public School moved into its new premises at 50, Sunset Grove on 28 August 1972. The new building was officially opened by our School Advisor, Mr Cao Yuyin, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education.

### Our new campus at Clementi Avenue 5

The school board negotiated with Ministry of Education to move over to a new campus in Avenue 5 Clementi New Town and to be renamed as Pei Tong Primary School in 1981. A plaque of honour installed in the new Pei Tong Primary School to commemorate the contributions made by the early pioneers, sponsors and members of the School Board.
