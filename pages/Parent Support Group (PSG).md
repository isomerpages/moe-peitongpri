# Parent Support Group (PSG)


## MK PSG


Children learn best when significant adults in their lives (teachers and parents) work together to support them. This bridges the gap between home and school and enhances children’s interest and motivation in learning.   

  

At MK@PT, our Parent Support Group (PSG) aims to foster a closer collaborative relationship between families and the school. Parents volunteered in event preparations, sharing sessions and various activities. 

  

Our PSG supported in our Racial Harmony Day and Teachers’ Day event preparations. One of our PSG parents also brought his pet stick insects to school and shared them with the children. Parents also conducted virtual storytelling sessions for our children. We would like to thank them for their constant support!
