# Learning for Life Programme (LLP)


## I’MADD- Music, Art, Drama and Dance


I’MADD is an LLP programme which provides opportunities for our students to build good character, values and people skills through Music, Art, Dance and Drama. Through this, our students will have the opportunities to develop a sense of belonging for Singapore while exploring and furthering their interest in the arts. We aim to provide experiences for all our students to explore, extend and excel through the different programmes offered at each level and develop the 21st century competencies.

## NE Musical


The main highlight of the LLP is our NE musical which combines music, art, dance, and drama into one performance. This musical will be performed by our P3 students as part of National Day celebration. Every P3 students will be on stage performing a scene related to Singapore for the musical. They will be prepped and trained for the performance during their music lessons. Through this experience, we hope to instil the values of respect and resilience, to develop confidence to be on stage and at the same time educate them more about Singapore.
