# PTPS Enriched Total Curriculum (PETC)

The key features of the PETC are:

*   Focus on **conceptual understanding** to enable students to sustain their learning;
*   Use of **questioning techniques** to hone students’ critical thinking skills·
*   Providing **authentic learning experiences** to make learning meaningful;
*   Practising **holistic assessment** by giving both **quantitative and qualitative feedback** to enable students to improve their learning and enhance their motivation to learn;
*   Providing **differentiated learning opportunities** to better suit and optimise students’ potential and
*   **Values-driven** to lay a strong foundation for students and prepare them to navigate future challenges and contribute positively to the community.


## Talent Programme (TP@PTPS)

We believe that ‘**Every Child Matters and Every Child Can Learn**’. To help our students **discover their strengths and interests**, the school provides a wide range of activities and experiences that are carefully pegged at differentiated levels to cater to the varied needs of each child thereby constituting our customised **talent programme - TP@PTPS**.

  

This programme offers **broad-based exposure for all students**; **opportunity for advanced pursuit** in areas of choice based on students’ interests; as well as **talent grooming and competitive exposure for those who demonstrate skills mastery and aptitude in selected areas**.

  

This tiered and customised approach informs the cumulative exposure and learning experiences of every Pei Tong student.
