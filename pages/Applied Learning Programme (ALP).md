## Objectives of the "PLANET" Programme


**The objectives of the “PLANET” Programme are as follows:**

(a) **Educate** students on the serious implications environmental issues have on mankind and the need for all to play an active role in promoting a green environment, specifically on sustainable living.  

(b) **Expose** them to different approaches to promote sustainable living, focusing on “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” (3Rs) and reduction of carbon emissions and footprints.

(c) **Equip** them with the knowledge, skills, and competencies to apply Science and Mathematical concepts and technology in an integrated manner to solve real life problems related to sustainable living. To do so, the school will expose students to a range of coding languages which can be applied to different scenarios and serve different purposes. Coding is leveraged as a key approach to teaching students computational skills in an intentional manner.

(d) **Equip** them with at least a problem-solving routine to build in them the confidence to play an active role in problem solving to make the world a better place to live in.

(e) **Develop** dispositions, inculcate values in the students and equip them with 21st century competencies (21st CC) for them to have the courage to take risks and ability to innovate to bring about positive changes to society in a responsible manner.

(f) **Nurture** in them the conviction to be an active citizen in promoting a green environment.
