# Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

PTPS ALP, titled “PLANET”, which stands for “Pei Tong Learn and Nurture the Environment with Technology”, adopts “STEM” as its strand and “Sustainable Living” for its contextual theme.

## Objectives of the "PLANET" Programme


**The objectives of the “PLANET” Programme are as follows:**

(a) **Educate** students on the serious implications environmental issues have on mankind and the need for all to play an active role in promoting a green environment, specifically on sustainable living.  

(b) **Expose** them to different approaches to promote sustainable living, focusing on “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” (3Rs) and reduction of carbon emissions and footprints.

(c) **Equip** them with the knowledge, skills, and competencies to apply Science and Mathematical concepts and technology in an integrated manner to solve real life problems related to sustainable living. To do so, the school will expose students to a range of coding languages which can be applied to different scenarios and serve different purposes. Coding is leveraged as a key approach to teaching students computational skills in an intentional manner.

(d) **Equip** them with at least a problem-solving routine to build in them the confidence to play an active role in problem solving to make the world a better place to live in.

(e) **Develop** dispositions, inculcate values in the students and equip them with 21st century competencies (21st CC) for them to have the courage to take risks and ability to innovate to bring about positive changes to society in a responsible manner.

(f) **Nurture** in them the conviction to be an active citizen in promoting a green environment.

## Desired Student Outcomes of “PLANET”


The school seeks to develop in the students the following dispositions as well as equip them with the following competencies after they have gone through the “PLANET” experience in PTPS:

(a) Are **joyful** and **curious** learners of STEM;

(b) Have the **desire to explore, experiment and take risks** to innovate and solve problems;

(c) Are **critical thinkers** who are able to collaborate with others to develop solutions to real life problems, especially in the area of sustainable living;

(d) Are **effective communicators** who share their ideas and inspire others to play an active role in making living more sustainable;

(e) Are **self-directed** in their learning and

(f) Are **active citizens** who seek to make positive changes that result in a greener environment.

## Tier 1 Activities


All students are engaged in the “Change Maker” projects to provide them with opportunities to have hands-on experience to address different issues related to sustainable living. 

  

They are presented with real-life problems and are required to work on solutions in teams and develop prototypes where applicable, with the application of STEM skills and knowledge in an integrated manner. 

  

To guide the students in the solutioning process, the school adopts the “Design for Change” (DfC) Approach which incorporates the ‘**Feel, Imagine, Do and Share**’ (FIDS) process for the “Change Maker” projects.  The complexity of the projects is progressive in nature, based on the development of the 21st CC outcomes.

## Tier 2 Activities


Several platforms are available for students interested in STEM and environmental concerns to delve deeper into these areas and enhance their knowledge and skills. These platforms include co-curricular activities (CCAs), such as the Environmental Science Club and the InfoComm Club. These clubs enable students to participate in initiatives aimed at preserving and maintaining the school environment and promoting sustainable practices among members of the school community.
