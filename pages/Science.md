# Science 


The focus of the PTPS science curriculum is to promote the spirit of scientific inquiry and this is carried out through our customised **Developing Inquiring Learners Through ‘5E’ (DILE) programme**. 

DILE is a school-wide science programme that comprises comprehensive thematic teaching and learning packages for all themes in the Primary 3 to 6 syllabi.  Each package:

*   adopts the **‘5E’ (Engage, Explore, Explain, Evaluate and Extend)** approach as the key pedagogy in the teaching of Science. This approach takes the students through the process of inquiry and inculcates this as a habit of mind and for learning.
*   incorporates **Assessment for Learning strategies** (AfL) such as ‘Check-In and Check Out’ to ensure that students have the necessary understanding before moving on to the next stage of learning;
*   includes **performance tasks** to provide authentic learning experiences to make learning fun and meaningful for our students;
*   includes a section on **concept mapping** that focuses on guiding the students to link concepts and consolidate their understanding;
*   includes **activities in the Student Learning Space (SLS)** to promote self-directed learning and
*   includes exercises for our students to **apply scientific concepts in different contexts**.

In addition, one key focus of the programme is the use of **Questioning Techniques** (QT) and thinking routines to scaffold our students’ learning. As such, students will be able to construct their knowledge actively and assimilate new concepts. The content of the syllabus is organised into 5 themes, namely Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions. The syllabus adopts the ‘spiral’ approach which is characterised by the revisiting of scientific concepts and process skills at different levels and with increasing depth. This approach allows the learning of concepts and skills to match students’ cognitive development.

## Learning Journeys


Learning journeys are an integral part of our science curriculum and provide authentic contexts in which knowledge comes alive for our students. 

This year (2022), the following learning journeys are planned:-

*   Primary 3 – Singapore Science Centre (Physical Experience) 
*   Primary 4 – Garden by the Bay (Physical Experience)
*   Primary 6 – Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve (Virtual Experience)

## E2k Science Programme

The E2K Science Programme is a Science enrichment programme for our upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science.  This programme aims to engage selected students in scientific inquiry that will help them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions which scientists possess through scientific investigations involving advanced science concepts. It also seeks to develop important 21st-century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills in the participants.

## Pei Tong Science Explorer Programme

The Pei Tong Science Explorer Programme is designed by our teachers to provide a variety of authentic learning experiences for our P3 and P5 students. Through a series of interesting learning activities that involve creative thinking and independent research skills, students can strengthen and deepen their science knowledge. To further enhance our students’ self-directedness, we provide several opportunities for them to take ownership of their own learning.

## P5 Applied Science Programme (ASP) and P6 Science Experimental Techniques

The Science department has organized a series of workshops to focus on providing our students with authentic learning experiences and exposing students to experimental skills, and techniques. Through these processes of inquiry and experimentation, students were able to apply scientific concepts and transfer their learning. To top it off, learning was made fun and meaningful. Our students have shown a high level of interest, involvement and engagement.
