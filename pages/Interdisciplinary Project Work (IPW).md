# Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)


In Pei Tong, IPW is based on the approach of Problem-based Learning (PBL). The project aims to provide opportunities for students to deepen their learning by synthesizing knowledge from various subjects.  

  

They are also platforms for students to develop 21st Century Competencies such as critical and inventive thinking as well as communication, collaboration, and information skills. Through the course of the projects, students will also play the roles of self-directed learners as well as active contributors.

  

Students will be given time and space to question, reflect and do independent research before they are tasked to share information and present their findings in teams. IPW allows students to apply their learning in real-world situations and sharpen their problem-solving skills.

## Primary 3


PBL in P3 IPW is anchored on the Design for Change framework which is a global movement that cultivates the ‘I Can’ mindset in every student. This ‘I Can’ spirit empowers students and provides them an opportunity to express their ideas for a better world and put them into action. It is a model that aims to develop and strengthen empathy in students through an authentic learning setting.

The project directs students to be change agents who actively think of possible solutions and act on the ideas to bring about positive changes to the world around them.

  

## Primary 5


P5 IPW builds on the problem-solving skills developed in earlier years by adding computational thinking into the PBL and expanding the project task to incorporate issues observed in the community. Building on P4 Coding skills, the P5 IPW aims to allow students to get creative in coming up with solutions with the aid of digital technology. Using Micro Bits and sensors, students will work in groups to create prototypes that work towards improvement in the community.

  

The project aims to help students to be better prepared for the technological advancements in the fast-changing world. This also encourages students to be curious about the world around them, to see themselves as active members of the community, and to be change agents in making the community a better place for all.
