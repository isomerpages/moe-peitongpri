<h2><strong>Be Part of Teachers‚Äô Day 2025 </strong>üçé</h2>
<p>Teachers‚Äô Day is a time to say <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to those who have
guided, encouraged, and inspired us. If you are Pei Tong alumni, you have
two special ways to join in the celebration this year:</p>
<h3>1. Write a Note of Thanks ‚úçÔ∏è</h3>
<p>A few words from you can brighten a teacher‚Äôs day. Share your e-message
at <strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/saythanksptps" class="decorated-link" rel="noopener" target="_new">this link</a></strong> and
let your encouragement make this Teachers‚Äô Day even more memorable!</p>
<h3>2. Visit Your Teacher üíê</h3>
<p>Want to say thank you in person? You can <strong>make an appointment*</strong> to
visit your teachers on <strong>Thursday, 4 September 2025</strong>.</p>
