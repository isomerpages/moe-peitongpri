<h2>MK Vision and Mission</h2>
<p>To provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing
quality preschool education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing
quality improvements in the sector</p>
<h2>Beliefs</h2>
<p><strong>Children are curious learners.</strong>
</p>
<p>They have an innate sense of curiosity that should be nurtured. They wonder,
question, explore and seek to make sense and meaning of their world. By
acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover and learn more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children are active learners.</strong>
</p>
<p>They learn by doing. They are also more likely to&nbsp;understand and
remember skills and concepts learnt through participation, exploration
and experimentation involving real-life objects and experiences</p>
<p><strong>Children are competent learners.</strong>
</p>
<p>Their thinking and reasoning skills evolve over time as they build new
knowledge upon their existing knowledge and experiences. Through constantly
thinking and reflecting about their learning, children deepen their understanding
of how the world works.</p>
