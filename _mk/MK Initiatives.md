<h2>Partnership with Pei Tong Primary School</h2>
<p>In MK@Pei Tong, our students will be invited to visit and participate
in events conducted in Pei Tong Primary School. The children will participate
in activities such as Art Week, Total Defense Day display, movie screenings
at the school library. Through this partnership, the children will be familiarised
with the primary school environment and are able to explore through a variety
of activities outside MK.</p>

<h2>MK Reads!</h2>
<p>As part of our MK Reads! initiative, we have created a rich reading environment
for our MK children. They can explore a diverse collection of age-appropriate
books in different genres and Mother Tongue languages at our reading corners.</p>
<p>To further enhance their reading experiences, children also have the opportunity
to visit the Molly Bus and the library at Pei Tong Primary School, borrow
books from the MK Classroom Library to engage in reading activities with
their families, and participate in storytelling sessions with parents.</p>

<h2>K1/K2 Level Day</h2>
<p>Our MK Level Days are held bi-weekly for our respective levels. During
Level Days, children will interact and learn alongside their peers from
other classes. Outdoor games, music and movement and learning of values
(i.e. kindness, honesty, care, responsibility and respect) are some of
the activities children are engaged in during our Level Day.</p>

<h2>Parent Support Group</h2>
<p>Children learn best when significant adults in their lives (teachers and
parents) work together to support them. This bridges the gap between home
and school and enhances childrenâ€™s interest and motivation in learning.</p>

<p>At MK@PT, our Parent Support Group (PSG) aims to foster a closer collaborative
relationship between families and the school. Parents volunteered in event
preparations, sharing sessions and various activities.</p>
