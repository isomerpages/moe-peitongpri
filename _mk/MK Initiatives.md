## PARTNERSHIP WITH PEI TONG PRIMARY


In MK@Pei Tong, our students will be invited to visit and participate in events conducted in Pei Tong Primary School. The children will participate in activities such as Art Week, Total Defense Day display, movie screenings at the school library etc. Through this partnership, the children will be familiarised with the primary school environment and are able to explore through a variety of activities outside MK.


## MK @ PT Library

As part of our MK Reads! initiative, we have set up a physical library for MK children to visit. We have a variety of age-appropriate books of different genres and Mother-Tongue languages. 

Through this initiative, we hope to instill love and joy for reading in our children. Parents who have donated preloved books during our book drive have also been included in our collection.
