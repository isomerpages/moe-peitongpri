At MK@PT, our teachers plan cultural activities for children on a monthly basis. We aim to raise our children’s awareness of the diverse cultures in Singapore. 

  

This also nurtures an appreciation for our local ethnic cultures. In Term 1, children explored topics on different cultural instruments, traditional games, crafts etc.

## Chinese New Year

Our Chinese New Year Celebration was held on 31 January 2022. The children had a meaningful time as they participated in various Chinese cultural activities e.g., tiger craft, food tasting etc. 

  

They also learnt more about the festival through resources prepared by the teacher. In addition, they also had fun as they sang and danced to Chinese New Year songs with their friends.

In Term 1, the K2 children learnt about the human body and healthy eating. In line with our theme, we invited personnel from Science Center (KidsSTOP) to conduct the “Healthy Kitchen” programme.

  

Through this programme, the children learnt the importance of having a balanced diet and created their own healthy plates in accordance with guidelines from the Health Promotion Board (HPB).

The children had a virtual slime-making workshop. They had an enjoyable time creating their own glittery slime. 

  

In line with our Term 1 theme 'My Senses', the children had the opportunity to use their sense of touch to feel the slime, and their sense of sight to observe the changes as they added different ingredients.
