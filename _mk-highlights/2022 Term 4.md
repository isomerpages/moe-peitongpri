On the last day of August, we celebrated Teacher’s Day to show our appreciation to our teachers and school staff. The children had a wonderful time playing games such as ‘Blindfold the Teacher’ whereby the teachers had to identify the voice of the children. The game showed how well the teachers recognised their children’s voices! They also took many photos with their teachers using hand-made props painstakingly made by our parent volunteers. To add on to the celebrations, the children gathered in the music room for another game; ‘Guess Your Teacher’s Voice’ with the entire cohort. As a finale, the children had a mass dance together. The children had a great time celebrating Teacher's Day with their teachers and friends!

The school celebrated this special day on Friday, 6th October 2022. To instil joy and happiness, the teachers planned a range of fun activities for the children. The activities included a mass dance and various games that encouraged teamwork. During snack time, the children created their own Happiness Biscuit which consisted of graham crackers, yogurt, and juicy grapes. The children were especially delighted to watch the Children’s Day video greetings made by parents! To sum up the celebration, a Show & Tell session was conducted whereby the children brought one favourite item from home and did a mini presentation in front of the whole class. Through these activities, the children had a fun and meaningful experience on this joyous day.

The children made a trip to Science Centre Singapore for the STEAM Festival 2022. They explored three types of spaces; Inner Space, Living Space and Outer Space through education and interactive activities conducted by vendors e.g. Faber-Castell, UHU glue and Terraminds etc. These vendors provided the children with the opportunities to experience the use of physical materials such as robots and art materials in our everyday lives. 

  

Some booths were informational e.g. the Space Observatory by Republic Polytechnic where the children experienced wearing an astronaut head gear and walking under the stars and planets. At the same time, they learnt the names of the planets! At another booth, the children learnt about the Venus Flytrap’s growth and ways to care for it. 

  

The children also explored hands-on activities such as making their own hand-sanitisers, sun catchers and many more! The children had an amazing time, and they learnt a lot about the use of science, technology, and engineering through this learning journey.

The K2 children visited the MINT Museum of Toys and learnt about the concept of time as well as communications and transport systems through art, music and movement activities based on toys such as Snowy Alarm Clock, Batman and Hook Robot. Through these creative expressions, they had opportunities to foster social and cognitive skills and gained self-confidence that would benefit them in their transition to primary school.

## K2 Transition Programme


  

As part of our K2 transition programme, the children learnt about the larger school system through hands-on learning experiences. The MK teachers worked closely with teachers from Pei Tong Primary School to plan meaningful activities for the children. These activities included a tour around the school facilities, buying snacks from the canteen and participation in activities/classes conducted by the primary school teachers.

The school celebrated Deepavali on Friday 28th October 2022. Through a presentation by the teachers and sharing of videos from children and families who celebrate the festival, the children learnt about the significance of Deepavali and how the special occasion is celebrated. One of the festive foods presented was thosai and the children had a chance to experience how it was prepared. For snack, the children were introduced to another South Indian food - idiyappam (putu mayam). After snack, the children had another activity where they explored tying a saree and veshti on for their friends. The children had a great as they brought home knowledge and information on Deepavali.

Our K2 children had their ‘K2 Celebrates’ in October 2022. The theme of this year’s K2 Celebrates revolved around the friendships forged since the day these children entered MOE Kindergarten @ Pei Tong. We also celebrated the milestones that every MK child has achieved with the support and guidance from his/her family. Throughout their kindergarten years in MK, the K2 children have portrayed skills and values such as building relationships with others, recognising that everyone is unique and showing respect to people whom they interact with.

## Molly Bus

As part of our Term 4 Happy Readers Programme, we invited Molly Bus from the National Library Board to MK@Pei Tong. Through this initiative, we brought the library experience to our children and to inculcate the passion for reading and lifelong learning in them. The Molly Bus is specially designed to provide children with an immersive library experience. Teachers demonstrated the process of borrowing books, e.g. scanning of the library card and scanning the barcode of the books to the children. The librarians & teachers conducted storytelling sessions for the children, and they also did some free reading in the mobile library.
