Outdoor learning is an integral part of a child’s everyday life. Outdoor learning activities at MK@PT are created to provide children with rich sensorial experiences that support their growth and development. Children are given daily opportunities to play, explore and learn in a natural environment as well as at urban outdoor spaces such as the playground, field etc. At MK@PT, we aim to provide children with a healthy start to an active lifestyle and develop emotional connectedness to the environment and community.

Racial Harmony Day is held annually on 21 July, and it teaches children the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony in Singapore’s multicultural and multi-ethnic society. Our teachers at MK@PT prepared Racial Harmony pop-up booths filled with fun and interactive activities. Some of these activities included Chinese calligraphy, weaving, designing henna and more. Through these meaningful activities, the children attained a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different races and cultures in Singapore.
