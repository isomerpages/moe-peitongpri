# Primary 3 to 6


P3 to P6 programmes progress from lower primary to focus on gross and fine motor coordination and game skills. Students also learn basic survival skills and fitness. Students grow in social skills and relationship management as they participate in activities that require greater teamwork.

## P3 Swimsafer


As part of the P3 PHE Syllabus, the Swimsafer Programme aims to equip students with basic swimming skills for water survival. Students have the opportunity to develop their swimming skills further at their own pace in a fun yet safe manner. This is also an avenue for students to cultivate self-discipline and sportsmanship.

## P3 Inline Skating


This programme covers the fundamentals of inline skating to ensure that students learn it the proper, safe and fun way. Through progressive exercises and drills to help students perform skating skills, students will learn and understand the value of setting goals in small steps, hard work and resilience.

## P4 Kin-Ball

Kin-Ball is an unusual game that has been recently introduced, as it is played with three teams, all competing against each other to win at the same time. The nature of Kin-Ball requires a great deal of teamwork, integrity and some level of fitness due to the fast-paced nature of the game. It is an excellent opportunity for students to learn how to cooperate with each other and to display school values.  

## P4 Resilience Walk

Annually, P4 students embark on a 4km walk from the school to West Coast Park to conclude their year before promoting to P5 - “Resilience”. Through the Resilience Walk, we aim to foster resilience in our students and educate them to be socially and environmentally conscious when using shared spaces. Students will also have opportunities to bond and strengthen friendships as they then engage in outdoor activities and play at the park. As students are also taught healthy eating in school, we also encourage students to demonstrate their learning by bringing healthy snacks for a short picnic at the park.

## P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp

The signature 3 Day P5 camp aims to cultivate school values such as resilience in students as they get to nurture their outdoor skills, knowledge and attitudes in an authentic context. The objectives of these programmes are basic survival skills, fitness, gross and fine motor coordination, games skills and concepts.

Through challenges experienced in an unfamiliar setting, we hope for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies, foster teamwork, and forge strong bonds with their classmates to become a tightly-knitted P5 cohort.

## P6 Post-PSLE Activities


The sporting highlight for P6 Students after their exams is the I’mPossible Para-sport Engagement session that is held during the I’mPossible Week. P6 students get to learn and play with Para-athletes in a para-sport such as Wheelchair basketball, badminton, and Cerebral Palsy Football. It is an eye-opening experience for students as they get inspired by the attitudes and achievements of the Para-athletes.

P6 students also learn Hip Hop moves and grooves. With assisted choreography from dance instructors, the classes learn and practice their own class dance to perform at their P6 Graduation Event. It is a wonderful way for our P6 students to conclude their Primary School journey.
