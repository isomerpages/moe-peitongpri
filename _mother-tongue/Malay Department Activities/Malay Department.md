To encourage an authentic outside classroom learning experience, the Active Recess activity aims to promote joy in learning while consolidating students’ learning through games. During Active Recess, students from all levels were introduced to the different ICT apps created by our Malay Language Centre of Singapore. These creative and fun apps aimed to promote joy in learning the language.  The P1-P4 immersed themselves in the Pintar Kata app and the P5 and P6 had loads of fun with the Pintar Peribahasa app. Being digital natives, these apps definitely piqued the interest of our students and made learning engaging.

## Creative Writing Competition (Penulis Kreatif)

P3-P6 students participated in a creative writing competition in September 2020. Due to the SMM of Covid-19, this competition was held in place of Ops Baca, an annual language competition aimed at providing a platform to deepen the love for Bahasa Melayu while engaging in various fun activities. Organised by the People’s Association Malay Activities Executive Committee, this creative writing competition was organised with a unique twist where students’ work was put on social media to enthuse our digital natives.3 of our P3, 3 of our P4 and 2 of our P5 received prizes for their work. Well done!

## Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Activity


The MTL Fortnight activities serve to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. The activities that were held provided authentic opportunities for students to use MTL and experience the culture. 

  

<b><u>MTL Fortnight 2022: Malay Folklore</u></b>

For our MTL Fortnight in 2022, we chose Malay folklore as our theme. Our objective was to familiarize the students with the various genres of folklores. Malay folklore refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and stories that have been passed down through many generations in oral and written forms among the indigenous populations of Southeast Asia. To ease our students into the various genres, we selected three themes for the various levels.

  

<b><u>P1 & P2: Animal Folklore</u></b>

Growing up, many of us would have been regaled with stories of the exploits of Sang Kancil, the tiny mousedeer that outwitted its bigger and stronger adversaries such as the tiger, snake and crocodile. Told to us by our elders, these tales invariably began with “Once upon a time” or “Long before your time” and ended with a wise saying or observation. Based on Authentic Learning, students are engaged in a variety of activities, from ICT to craft work, culminating with them dressing up as their favourite characters

  

<b><u>P3 & P4: Humurous Folklore</b></u>

Humorous story always gets everyone laughing. The larger-than-life characters like Pak Pandir, Si Luncai, Pak Kaduk dan mak Andeh manifests the traits of funny and silly kampung folks, but it nonetheless teaches that laziness and naivety will get one in trouble. Using various ICT apps and engaging in group work, the students were able to learn about the misadventures of the characters and pick one to dress up as. The students were engaged and may sounded out their interest to follow up on other genres of folklore.

  

<b><u>P5 & P6: Heroic Folklore</b></u>

Through adventures of Hang Tuah and friends, Badang, Tanggang, Puteri Gunung Ledang, Tun Faimah, Mahsuri and Hang Nadim, valuable lessons of bravery, virtue and right from wrong are learnt. Students were excited to learn in depth about the different situations that the characters were faced with that called for them to display such virtuous characters. Teachers tied in the values displayed to the character strengths that we propound in our school.

To encourage authentic outside classroom learning experience, the Active Recess activity aims to promote joy in learning while consolidating students’ learning through games. To ensure our students continue to be meaningfully engaged after school exams, our P4 and P5 teachers sourced out fun language games for the students. A Malay version of Scrabble, Sahibba was introduced to them. Being accustomed to Scrabble, they had to adjust to Sahibba but much learning took place. The students were happy to ‘show off’ their vocabulary in the building of words.

## P5 Batik Painting

Primary 5 Malay students were involved in a 2-week programme which gave the students an opportunity to engage in various activities related to the theme ‘Batik’. The week kicked off with students immersing themselves in the history of batik.

Blended-learning approach using the SLS portal was incorporated to make the teaching and learning process more interactive as well as meaningful. The e-learning element allowed students to have a greater understanding of the art of batik making and the different uses for it, all at their own pace.

On top of that, students learned the content through exploration and discussion. The highlight of the programme was when the students showcased their talents through a hands-on batik painting activity. Some beautiful pieces were recognized and presented with prizes. As a closure, students completed a reflection using the Padlet app and made suggested crafts with their batik pieces with their families during the March holidays. Through the reflections, the students voiced that the activities were enriching and enjoyable!

On 29th April 2022, the Malay Department organized a Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebration via Zoom. The students learnt about the significance of Hari Raya Aidilfitri and ketupat. Prior to the celebration, students had to decorate their own ketupats which were then hanged around the school. The highlight of the event was when Mr Ketupat went into each class while the celebration was going on. The students were ecstatic when they saw Mr Ketupat giving out green packets to students. The students also participated in a Hari Raya quiz and watched an outfit change challenge video by the P5 and P6 Malay language students. The celebration was concluded with a mass Hari Raya dance which was demonstrated by Pei Tong teachers in the video. It was definitely a fun and meaningful celebration for everybody!
