# Family Matters @ School


Pei Tong Primary School partners with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to promote Family Matters@School (FMS).  

Family Matters@School is a school-based programme that offers parents and students easy access to family life education programmes and resources supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. It seeks to help parents and students enhance the quality of family life by equipping them with the skills and confidence to build strong relationships. FMS programmes include talks about equipping parents with effective parenting skills and workshops which provide bonding opportunities for parent and child.       

Parents who wish to know more about FMS programmes can contact the school's FMS coordinator, Ms Catherine Banton at [fms\_peitong@yahoo.com](mailto:fms_peitong@yahoo.com).
