<p>SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources
for all students&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn at their own pace and collaboratively.&nbsp;With
the SLS, students can take&nbsp;greater ownership of their learning and&nbsp;pick
up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning.&nbsp;Teachers
will also use the SLS to&nbsp;complement classroom teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The SLS is collectively shaped by teachers and students. Taking into consideration
their ideas and feedback on the resources and tools, the system is developed
iteratively to stay dynamic and responsive.</p>
