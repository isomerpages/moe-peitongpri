# Overview

As part of Ministry of Educationâ€™s (MOE) commitment to nurture future-ready learners, an online learning platform known as the&nbsp;[**Singapore**&nbsp;**Student Learning Space (SLS)**](https://learning.moe.edu.sg/)&nbsp;has been developed and rolled out in 2018 by MOE.  

The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn at their own pace and collaboratively.&nbsp;With the SLS, students can take&nbsp;greater ownership of their learning and&nbsp;pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning.&nbsp;Teachers will also use the SLS to&nbsp;complement classroom teaching and learning.

The SLS is collectively shaped by teachers and students. Taking into consideration their ideas and feedback on the resources and tools, the system is developed iteratively to stay dynamic and responsive.
